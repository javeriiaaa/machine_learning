       "[' President Faust, Board of Overseers, faculty, alumni, friends, proud parents, members of the ad board, and graduates of the greatest university in the world, I\\'m honored to be with you today because, let\\'s face it, you accomplished something I never could. If I get through this speech, it\\'ll be the first time I actually finish something at Harvard. Class of 2017, congratulations! I\\'m an unlikely speaker, not just because I dropped out, but because we\\'re technically in the same generation. We walked this yard less than a decade apart, studied the same ideas and slept through the same Ec10 lectures. We may have taken different paths to get here, especially if you came all the way from the Quad, but today I want to share what I\\'ve learned about our generation and the world we\\'re building together. But first, the last couple of days have brought back a lot of good memories. How many of you remember exactly what you were doing when you got that email telling you that you got into Harvard? I was playing Civilization and I ran downstairs, got my dad, and for some reason, his reaction was to video me opening the email. That could have been a really sad video. I swear getting into Harvard is still the thing my parents are most proud of me for. What about your first lecture at Harvard? Mine was Computer Science 121 with the incredible Harry Lewis. I was late so I threw on a t-shirt and didn\\'t realize until afterwards it was inside out and backwards with my tag sticking out the front. I couldn\\'t figure out why no one would talk to me -- except one guy, KX Jin, he just went with it. We ended up doing our problem sets together, and now he runs a big part of Facebook. And that, Class of 2017, is why you should be nice to people. But my best memory from Harvard was meeting Priscilla. I had just launched this prank website Facemash, and the ad board wanted to \"see me\". Everyone thought I was going to get kicked out. My parents came to help me pack. My friends threw me a going away party. As luck would have it, Priscilla was at that party with her friend. We met in line for the bathroom in the Pfoho Belltower, and in what must be one of the all time romantic lines, I said: \"I\\'m going to get kicked out in three days, so we need to go on a date quickly.\" Actually, any of you graduating can use that line. I didn\\'t end up getting kicked out -- I did that to myself. Priscilla and I started dating. And, you know, that movie made it seem like Facemash was so important to creating Facebook. It wasn\\'t. But without Facemash I wouldn\\'t have met Priscilla, and she\\'s the most important person in my life, so you could say it was the most important thing I built in my time here. We\\'ve all started lifelong friendships here, and some of us even families. That\\'s why I\\'m so grateful to this place. Thanks, Harvard. Today I want to talk about purpose. But I\\'m not here to give you the standard commencement about finding your purpose. We\\'re millennials. We\\'ll try to do that instinctively. Instead, I\\'m here to tell you finding your purpose isn\\'t enough. The challenge for our generation is creating a world where everyone has a sense of purpose. One of my favorite stories is when John F Kennedy visited the NASA space center, he saw a janitor carrying a broom and he walked over and asked what he was doing. The janitor responded: \"Mr. President, I\\'m helping put a man on the moon\". Purpose is that sense that we are part of something bigger than ourselves, that we are needed, that we have something better ahead to work for. Purpose is what creates true happiness. You\\'re graduating at a time when this is especially important. When our parents graduated, purpose reliably came from your job, your church, your community. But today, technology and automation are eliminating many jobs. Membership in communities is declining. Many people feel disconnected and depressed, and are trying to fill a void. As I\\'ve traveled around, I\\'ve sat with children in juvenile detention and opioid addicts, who told me their lives could have turned out differently if they just had something to do, an after school program or somewhere to go. I\\'ve met factory workers who know their old jobs aren\\'t coming back and are trying to find their place. To keep our society moving forward, we have a generational challenge -- to not only create new jobs, but create a renewed sense of purpose. I remember the night I launched Facebook from my little dorm in Kirkland House. I went to Noch\\'s with my friend KX. I remember telling him I was excited to connect the Harvard community, but one day someone would connect the whole world. The thing is, it never even occurred to me that someone might be us. We were just college kids. We didn\\'t know anything about that. There were all these big technology companies with resources. I just assumed one of them would do it. But this idea was so clear to us -- that all people want to connect. So we just kept moving forward, day by day. I know a lot of you will have your own stories just like this. A change in the world that seems so clear you\\'re sure someone else will do it. But they won\\'t. You will. But it\\'s not enough to have purpose yourself. You have to create a sense of purpose for others. I found that out the hard way. You see, my hope was never to build a company, but to make an impact. And as all these people started joining us, I just assumed that\\'s what they cared about too, so I never explained what I hoped we\\'d build. A couple years in, some big companies wanted to buy us. I didn\\'t want to sell. I wanted to see if we could connect more people. We were building the first News Feed, and I thought if we could just launch this, it could change how we learn about the world. Nearly everyone else wanted to sell. Without a sense of higher purpose, this was the startup dream come true. It tore our company apart. After one tense argument, an advisor told me if I didn\\'t agree to sell, I would regret the decision for the rest of my life. Relationships were so frayed that within a year or so every single person on the management team was gone. That was my hardest time leading Facebook. I believed in what we were doing, but I felt alone. And worse, it was my fault. I wondered if I was just wrong, an imposter, a 22 year-old kid who had no idea how the world worked. Now, years later, I understand that *is* how things work with no sense of higher purpose. It\\'s up to us to create it so we can all keep moving forward together. Today I want to talk about three ways to create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose: by taking on big meaningful projects together, by redefining equality so everyone has the freedom to pursue purpose, and by building community across the world. First, let\\'s take on big meaningful projects. Our generation will have to deal with tens of millions of jobs replaced by automation like self-driving cars and trucks. But we have the potential to do so much more together. Every generation has its defining works. More than 300,000 people worked to put a man on the moon \\\\\\'96 including that janitor. Millions of volunteers immunized children around the world against polio. Millions of more people built the Hoover dam and other great projects. These projects didn\\'t just provide purpose for the people doing those jobs, they gave our whole country a sense of pride that we could do great things. Now it\\'s our turn to do great things. I know, you\\'re probably thinking: I don\\'t know how to build a dam, or get a million people involved in anything. But let me tell you a secret: no one does when they begin. Ideas don\\'t come out fully formed. They only become clear as you work on them. You just have to get started. If I had to understand everything about connecting people before I began, I never would have started Facebook. Movies and pop culture get this all wrong. The idea of a single eureka moment is a dangerous lie. It makes us feel inadequate since we haven\\'t had ours. It prevents people with seeds of good ideas from getting started. Oh, you know what else movies get wrong about innovation? No one writes math formulas on glass. That\\'s not a thing. It\\'s good to be idealistic. But be prepared to be misunderstood. Anyone working on a big vision will get called crazy, even if you end up right. Anyone working on a complex problem will get blamed for not fully understanding the challenge, even though it\\'s impossible to know everything upfront. Anyone taking initiative will get criticized for moving too fast, because there\\'s always someone who wants to slow you down. In our society, we often don\\'t do big things because we\\'re so afraid of making mistakes that we ignore all the things wrong today if we do nothing. The reality is, anything we do will have issues in the future. But that can\\'t keep us from starting. So what are we waiting for? It\\'s time for our generation-defining public works. How about stopping climate change before we destroy the planet and getting millions of people involved manufacturing and installing solar panels? How about curing all diseases and asking volunteers to track their health data and share their genomes? Today we spend 50x more treating people who are sick than we spend finding cures so people don\\'t get sick in the first place. That makes no sense. We can fix this. How about modernizing democracy so everyone can vote online, and personalizing education so everyone can learn? These achievements are within our reach. Let\\'s do them all in a way that gives everyone in our society a role. Let\\'s do big things, not only to create progress, but to create purpose. So taking on big meaningful projects is the first thing we can do to create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose. The second is redefining equality to give everyone the freedom they need to pursue purpose. Many of our parents had stable jobs throughout their careers. Now we\\'re all entrepreneurial, whether we\\'re starting projects or finding or role. And that\\'s great. Our culture of entrepreneurship is how we create so much progress. Now, an entrepreneurial culture thrives when it\\'s easy to try lots of new ideas. Facebook wasn\\'t the first thing I built. I also built games, chat systems, study tools and music players. I\\'m not alone. JK Rowling got rejected 12 times before publishing Harry Potter. Even Beyonce had to make hundreds of songs to get Halo. The greatest successes come from having the freedom to fail. But today, we have a level of wealth inequality that hurts everyone. When you don\\'t have the freedom to take your idea and turn it into a historic enterprise, we all lose. Right now our society is way over-indexed on rewarding success and we don\\'t do nearly enough to make it easy for everyone to take lots of shots. Let\\'s face it. There is something wrong with our system when I can leave here and make billions of dollars in 10 years while millions of students can\\'t afford to pay off their loans, let alone start a business. Look, I know a lot of entrepreneurs, and I don\\'t know a single person who gave up on starting a business because they might not make enough money. But I know lots of people who haven\\'t pursued dreams because they didn\\'t have a cushion to fall back on if they failed. We all know we don\\'t succeed just by having a good idea or working hard. We succeed by being lucky too. If I had to support my family growing up instead of having time to code, if I didn\\'t know I\\'d be fine if Facebook didn\\'t work out, I wouldn\\'t be standing here today. If we\\'re honest, we all know how much luck we\\'ve had. Every generation expands its definition of equality. Previous generations fought for the vote and civil rights. They had the New Deal and Great Society. Now it\\'s our time to define a new social contract for our generation. We should have a society that measures progress not just by economic metrics like GDP, but by how many of us have a role we find meaningful. We should explore ideas like universal basic income to give everyone a cushion to try new things. We\\\\\\'92re going to change jobs many times, so we need affordable childcare to get to work and healthcare that aren\\'t tied to one company. We\\'re all going to make mistakes, so we need a society that focuses less on locking us up or stigmatizing us. And as technology keeps changing, we need to focus more on continuous education throughout our lives.\\\\ And yes, giving everyone the freedom to pursue purpose isn\\'t free. People like me should pay for it. Many of you will do well and you should too. That\\'s why Priscilla and I started the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and committed our wealth to promoting equal opportunity. These are the values of our generation. It was never a question of if we were going to do this. The only question was when. Millennials are already one of the most charitable generations in history. In one year, three of four US millennials made a donation and seven out of ten raised money for charity. But it\\'s not just about money. You can also give time. I promise you, if you take an hour or two a week -- that\\'s all it takes to give someone a hand, to help them reach their potential. Maybe you think that\\'s too much time. I used to. When Priscilla graduated from Harvard she became a teacher, and before she\\'d do education work with me, she told me I needed to teach a class. I complained: \"Well, I\\'m kind of busy. I\\'m running this company.\" But she insisted, so I taught a middle school program on entrepreneurship at the local Boys and Girls Club. I taught them lessons on product development and marketing, and they taught me what it\\'s like feeling targeted for your race and having a family member in prison. I shared stories from my time in school, and they shared their hope of one day going to college too. For five years now, I\\\\\\'92ve been having dinner with those kids every month. One of them threw me and Priscilla our first baby shower. And next year they\\\\\\'92re going to college. Every one of them. First in their families. We can all make time to give someone a hand. Let\\'s give everyone the freedom to pursue their purpose -- not only because it\\'s the right thing to do, but because when more people can turn their dreams into something great, we\\'re all better for it. Purpose doesn\\'t only come from work. The third way we can create a sense of purpose for everyone is by building community. And when our generation says \"everyone\", we mean everyone in the world. Quick show of hands: how many of you are from another country? Now, how many of you are friends with one of these folks? Now we\\'re talking. We have grown up connected.\\\\ In a survey asking millennials around the world what defines our identity, the most popular answer wasn\\'t nationality, religion or ethnicity, it was \"citizen of the world\". That\\'s a big deal. Every generation expands the circle of people we consider \"one of us\". For us, it now encompasses the entire world. We understand the great arc of human history bends towards people coming together in ever greater numbers -- from tribes to cities to nations -- to achieve things we couldn\\'t on our own. We get that our greatest opportunities are now global -- we can be the generation that ends poverty, that ends disease. We get that our greatest challenges need global responses too -- no country can fight climate change alone or prevent pandemics. Progress now requires coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community. But we live in an unstable time. There are people left behind by globalization across the world. It\\'s hard to care about people in other places if we don\\'t feel good about our lives here at home. There\\'s pressure to turn inwards. This is the struggle of our time. The forces of freedom, openness and global community against the forces of authoritarianism, isolationism and nationalism. Forces for the flow of knowledge, trade and immigration against those who would slow them down. This is not a battle of nations, it\\'s a battle of ideas. There are people in every country for global connection and good people against it. This isn\\'t going to be decided at the UN either. It\\'s going to happen at the local level, when enough of us feel a sense of purpose and stability in our own lives that we can open up and start caring about everyone. The best way to do that is to start building local communities right now. We all get meaning from our communities. Whether our communities are houses or sports teams, churches or music groups, they give us that sense we are part of something bigger, that we are not alone; they give us the strength to expand our horizons. That\\'s why it\\'s so striking that for decades, membership in all kinds of groups has declined as much as one-quarter. That\\'s a lot of people who now need to find purpose somewhere else. But I know we can rebuild our communities and start new ones because many of you already are. I met Agnes Igoye, who\\'s graduating today. Where are you, Agnes? She spent her childhood navigating conflict zones in Uganda, and now she trains thousands of law enforcement officers to keep communities safe. I met Kayla Oakley and Niha Jain, graduating today, too. Stand up. Kayla and Niha started a non-profit that connects people suffering from illnesses with people in their communities willing to help. I met David Razu Aznar, graduating from the Kennedy School today. David, stand up. He\\'s a former city councilor who successfully led the battle to make Mexico City the first Latin American city to pass marriage equality -- even before San Francisco. This is my story too. A student in a dorm room, connecting one community at a time, and keeping at it until one day we connect the whole world. Change starts local. Even global changes start small -- with people like us. In our generation, the struggle of whether we connect more, whether we achieve our biggest opportunities, comes down to this -- your ability to build communities and create a world where every single person has a sense of purpose. Class of 2017, you are graduating into a world that needs purpose. It\\'s up to you to create it. Now, you may be thinking: can I really do this? Remember when I told you about that class I taught at the Boys and Girls Club? One day after class I was talking to them about college, and one of my top students raised his hand and said he wasn\\'t sure he could go because he\\'s undocumented. He didn\\'t know if they\\'d let him in. Last year I took him out to breakfast for his birthday. I wanted to get him a present, so I asked him and he started talking about students he saw struggling and said \"You know, I\\'d really just like a book on social justice.\" I was blown away. Here\\'s a young guy who has every reason to be cynical. He didn\\'t know if the country he calls home -- the only one he\\'s known -- would deny him his dream of going to college. But he wasn\\'t feeling sorry for himself. He wasn\\'t even thinking of himself. He has a greater sense of purpose, and he\\'s going to bring people along with him. It says something about our current situation that I can\\'t even say his name because I don\\'t want to put him at risk. But if a high school senior who doesn\\'t know what the future holds can do his part to move the world forward, then we owe it to the world to do our part too. Before you walk out those gates one last time, as we sit in front of Memorial Church, I am reminded of a prayer, Mi Shebeirach, that I say whenever I face a challenge, that I sing to my daughter thinking about her future when I tuck her into bed. It goes: \"May the source of strength, who blessed the ones before us, help us *find the courage* to make our lives a blessing.\" I hope you find the courage to make your life a blessing. Congratulations, Class of \\'17! Good luck out there. ',\n",
       " ' Class of 2009! I don\\'t think I heard you. Class of 2009! First I\\'d like you to stand up, wave and cheer your supportive family and friends! I\\'m sure you can find them out there. Show your love! It is a great honor for me to be here today. Now wait a second. I know: that\\'s such a cliche? You\\'re thinking: every graduation speaker says that -- It\\'s a great honor. But, in my case, it really is so deeply true -- being here is more special and more personal for me than most of you know. I\\'d like to tell you why. A long time ago, in this cold September of 1962, there was a Steven\\'s co-op at this very university. That co-op had a kitchen with a ceiling that had been cleaned by student volunteers probably every decade or so. Picture a college girl named Gloria, climbing up high on a ladder, struggling to clean that filthy ceiling. Standing on the floor, a young boarder named Carl was admiring the view. And that\\'s how they met. They were my parents, so I suppose you could say I\\'m a direct result of that kitchen chemistry experiment, right here at Michigan. My Mom is here with us today, and we should probably go find the spot and put a plaque up on the ceiling that says: \"Thanks Mom and Dad!\" Everyone in my family went here at Michigan: me, my brother, my Mom and Dad -- all of us. My Dad actually got the quantity discount: all three and a half of his degrees are from here. His Ph.D. was in Communication Science because they thought Computers were just a passing fad. When he earned it 44 years ago. He and Mom made a big sacrifice for that. They argued at times over pennies, while raising my newborn brother. Mom typed my Dad\\'s dissertation by hand. Kind of ironic given it was a computer science dissertation. This velvet hood I\\'m wearing, this was my Dad\\'s. This diploma, just like the one you\\'re about to get, this was my Dad\\'s. And my underwear... oh never mind. Sorry. My father\\'s father worked in the Chevy plant in Flint, Michigan. He was an assembly line worker. He drove his two children here to Ann Arbor, and told them: That is where you\\'re going to go to college. I know it sounds funny now. Both of his kids did graduate from Michigan. That was the American dream. His daughter, Beverly, is with us today. My Grandpa used to carry an \"Alley Oop\" hammer -- a heavy iron pipe with a hunk of lead melted on the end. The workers made them during the sit-down strikes to protect themselves. When I was growing up, we used that hammer whenever we needed to pound a stake or something into the ground. It is wonderful that most people don\\'t need to carry a heavy blunt object for protection anymore. But just in case, I brought it with me. Al right... My Dad became a professor at... Michigan State, and I was an incredibly lucky boy. A professor\\'s life is pretty flexible, and he was able to spend oodles of time raising me. Could there be a better upbringing than university brat? What I\\'m trying to tell you is that this is WAY more than just a homecoming for me. It\\'s not easy for me to express how proud I am to be here, with my Mom, my brother and my wife Lucy, and with all of you, at this amazing institution that is responsible for my very existence. I am thrilled for all of you, and I\\'m thrilled for your families and friends, as all of us join the great, big Michigan family I feel I\\'ve been a part of all of my life. What I\\'m also trying to tell you is that I know exactly what it feels like to be sitting in your seat, listening to some old gasbag give a long-winded commencement speech. Don\\'t worry. I\\'ll be brief. I have a story about following dreams. Or maybe more accurately, it\\'s a story about finding a path to make those dreams real. You know what it\\'s like to wake up in the middle of the night with a vivid dream? And you know how, if you don\\'t have a pencil and pad by the bed, it will be completely gone the next morning? Well, I had one of those dreams when I was 23. When I suddenly woke up, I was thinking: what if we could download the whole web, and just keep the links and... I grabbed a pen and started writing! Sometimes it is important to wake up and stop dreaming. I spent the middle of that night scribbling out the details and convincing myself it would work. Soon after, I told my advisor, Terry Winograd, it would take a couple of weeks to download the web -- he nodded knowingly, fully aware it would take much longer but wise enough to not tell me. The optimism of youth is often underrated! Amazingly, At that time I had no thought of building a search engine. The idea wasn\\'t even on the radar. But, much later we happened upon a better way of ranking and we made a really great search engine, and Google was born. When a really great dream shows up, grab it! When I was here at Michigan, I had actually been taught how to make dreams real! I know it sounds funny, but that is what I learned in a summer camp converted into a training program called Leadershape. Yeh, we got a few out there. Their slogan is to have a \"healthy disregard for the impossible\". That program encouraged me to pursue a crazy idea at the time: I wanted to build a personal rapid transit system on campus to replace the buses. Yeh, you\\'re still working on that, I hear. It was a futuristic way of solving our transportation problem. I still think a lot about transportation -- you never loose a dream, it just incubates as a hobby. Many things that people labor hard to do now, like cooking, cleaning, and driving will require much less human time in the future. That is, if we \"have a healthy disregard for the impossible\" and actually build new solutions. I think it is often easier to make progress on mega-ambitious dreams. I know that sounds completely nuts. But, since no one else is crazy enough to do it, you have little competition. In fact, there are so few people this crazy that I feel like I know them all by first name. They all travel as if they are pack dogs and stick to each other like glue. The best people want to work the big challenges. That is what happened with Google. Our mission is to organize the world\\'s information and make it universally accessible and useful. How can that not get you excited? But we almost didn\\'t start Google because my co-founder Sergey and I were too worried about dropping out of our Ph.D. program. None of you have that issue, it seems. You are probably on the right track if you feel like a sidewalk worm during a rainstorm! That is about how we felt after we maxed out three credit cards buying hard disks off the back of a truck. That was actually the first hardware for Google. Parents and friends: more credit cards always help. What is the one sentence summary of how you change the world? Always work hard on something uncomfortably exciting! As a Ph.D. student, I actually had three projects I wanted to work on. Thank goodness my advisor said, \"why don\\'t you work on the web for a while\". He gave me some seriously good advice because the web was really growing with people and activity, even in 1995! Technology and especially the internet can really help you be lazy. Lazy? What I mean is a group of three people can write software that then millions can use and enjoy. Can three people answer the phone a million times? Find the leverage in the world, so you can be more lazy! Overall, I know it seems like the world is crumbling out there, but it is actually a great time in your life to get a little crazy, follow your curiosity, and be ambitious about it. Don\\'t give up on your dreams. The world needs you all! So here\\'s my final story: On a day like today, you might feel exhilarated — like you\\'ve just been shot out of a cannon at the circus -- and even invincible. Don\\'t ever forget that incredible feeling. But also: always remember that the moments we have with friends and family, the chances we have to do things that might make a big difference in the world, or even to make a small difference to someone you love — all those wonderful chances that life gives us, life also takes away. It can happen fast, and a whole lot sooner than you think. In late March 1996, soon after I had moved to Stanford for grad school, my Dad had difficultly breathing and drove to the hospital. Two months later, he died. I was completely devastated. Many years later, after a startup, after falling in love, and after so many of life\\'s adventures, I found myself thinking about my Dad. Lucy and I were far away in a steaming hot village walking through narrow streets. There were wonderful friendly people everywhere, but it was a desperately poor place -- people used the bathroom inside and it flowed out into the open gutter and straight into the river. We touched a boy with a limp leg, the result of paralysis from polio. Lucy and I were in rural India -- one of the few places where Polio still exists. Polio is transmitted fecal to oral, usually through filthy water. Well, my Dad had Polio. He went on a trip to Tennessee in the first grade and caught it. He was hospitalized for two months and had to be transported by military DC-3 back home -- his first flight. My Dad wrote, \"Then, I had to stay in bed for over a year, before I started back to school\". That is actually a quote from his fifth grade autobiography. My Dad had difficulty breathing his whole life, and the complications of Polio are what took him from us too soon. He would have been very upset that Polio still persists even though we have a vaccine. He would have been equally upset that back in India we had polio virus on our shoes from walking through the contaminated gutters that spread the disease. We were spreading the virus with every footstep, right under beautiful kids playing everywhere. The world is on the verge of eliminating polio, with 328 people infected so far. Let\\'s get it done soon. Perhaps one of you will do that. My Dad was valedictorian of the Flint Mandeville High School class of 1956 of about 90 kids. I happened across his graduating speech recently, and it blew me away. 53 years ago at his graduation my Dad said: \"...we are entering a changing world, one of automation and employment change where education is an economic necessity. We will have increased periods of time to do as we wish, as our work week and retirement age continue to decline... (Or we wish that were true....) We shall take part in, or witness, developments in science, medicine, and industry that we can only dream of today. ... It is said that the future of any nation can be determined by the care and preparation given to its youth. If all the youths of America were as fortunate in securing an education as we have been, then the future of the United States would be even more bright than it is today.\" If my Dad was alive today, the thing I think he would be most happy about is that Lucy and I have a baby in the hopper. Yeh, let\\'s cheer Lucy. I think he would have been annoyed that I hadn\\'t gotten my Ph.D. yet (thanks, Michigan!). Dad was so full of insights, of excitement about new things, to this day, I often wonder what he would think about some new development. If he were here today -- well, it would be one of the best days of his life. He\\'d be like a kid in a candy store. For a day, he\\'d be young again. Many of us are fortunate enough to be here with family. Some of us have dear friends and family to go home to. And who knows, perhaps some of you, like Lucy and I, are dreaming of future families of your own. Just like me, your families brought you here, and you brought them here. Please keep them close and remember: they are what really matters in life. Thanks, Mom; Thanks, Lucy. And thank you, all, very much. ',\n",
       " ' President Bach, former president Rudenstine, incoming president Faust, members of the Harvard corporation and the board of overseers. Members of the faculty, parents and especially the graduates. I\\'ve been waiting more than 30 years to say this. Dad I always told you I\\'d come back and get my degree. [Applause and some laughter.] I wanna thank Harvard for this honour. I\\'ll be changing my job next year and it will be nice to finally have a college degree on my resume. [Laughter.] I applaud the graduates for taking a much more direct route to your degrees. From our- my part I\\'m just happy that the Crimson called me Harvard\\'s most successful drop out. I guess that makes me valedictorian of my own special class. I did the best of everyone who failed. [Laughter.] But I also want to be recognised as the guy who got Steve Balmer to drop out of business school. [Laughter and then also applause.] I\\'m a bad influence. That\\'s why I was invited to speak at your graduation. If I\\'d spoken at your orientation fewer of you might be here today. [Laughter then also applause.] Harvard was a phenomenal experience for me. Academic life was fascinating. I used to sit in on lots of classes that I hadn\\'t even signed up for. And dorm life was terrific. I lived up at Radcliffe, in Courier House. [Cheering.] There were always a lot of people in my dorm room late at night discussing things, because everyone knew that I didn\\'t worry about getting up in the morning. [Laughter.] That\\'s how I came to be the leader of the antisocial group. We clunged each other as a way of validating our rejection of all those social people. Radcliffe was a great place to live. There were more women up there and most of the guys were math-science types. The combination offered me the best odds, if you know what I mean. [Laughing.] That\\'s where I learned the sad lesson that improving your odds doesn\\'t guarantee you success. [Laughing.] One of my biggest memories of Harvard came in January 1975. When I made a call from Courier House to a company in Albuquerque, New Mexico, that had begun making the worlds first personal computer. I offered to sell them software. I worried they would realise I was just a student in a dorm and hang up on me. Instead they said, we\\'re not quite ready, come see us in a month. Which was a good thing because we hadn\\'t written the software yet. [Laughing.] From that moment I worked day and night on the extra credit project that marked the end of my college education and the beginning of a remarkable journey with Microsoft. What I remember above all about Harvard, was being in the midst of so much energy and intelligence. It could be exhilarating, intimidating, sometimes even discouraging but always challenging. It was an amazing privilege and though I left early, I was transformed by my years at Harvard, the friendships I made and the ideas I worked on. But taking a serious look back, I do have one big regret. I left Harvard with no real awareness of the awful inequities in the world, the appalling disparities of health and wealth, and opportunity, that condemn millions of people to lives of despair. I learned a lot here at Harvard about new ideas and economics and politics. I got great exposure to the advances being made in the sciences. But humanities greatest advances are not in its discoveries, but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity. [Applause.] Whether through democracy, strong public education, quality health care or broad economic opportunity; reducing inequity is the highest human achievement. I left campus knowing little about the millions of young people cheated out of educational opportunities here in this country. And I knew nothing about the millions of people living in unspeakable poverty and disease in developing countries. It took me decades to find out. You graduates came to Harvard at a different time. You know more about the worlds inequities than the classes that came before. In your years here I\\'ve hope you\\'ve had a chance to think about how in this age of accelerating technology we can finally take on these inequities and we can solve them. Imagine just for the sake of discussion that you have a few hours a week and a few dollars a month to donate to a cause. And you wanted to spend that time and money where it would have the greatest impact in saving and improving lives. Where would you spend it? For Melinda and I the challenge is the same. How can we do the most good for the greatest number with the resources we have? During our discussions on this question, Melinda and I read an article about the millions of children who are dying every year in poor countries from diseases that we have long ago made harmless in this country. Measles, malaria, pneumonia, hepatitis-b, yellow fever. One disease that I had never heard of, rotavirus, was killing half a million children each year. None of them in the United States. We were shocked. We had assumed that if millions of children were dying and they could be saved, the world would make it a priority to discover and deliver the medicines to save them. But it did not. For under a dollar there were interventions that could save lives that just weren\\'t being delivered. If you believe that every life has equal value, it\\'s revolting to learn that some lives are seen as worth saving and others are not. We said to ourselves this can\\'t be true, but if it is true it deserves to be the priority of our giving. So we begin ou- began our work in the same way anyone here would begin it. We asked, how could the world let these children die? The answer is simple and harsh The market did not reward saving the lives of these children and governments did not subsidise it. So the children die because their mothers and fathers hadno power in the market and no voice in the system. But you and I have both We can make market for- forces work better for the poor if we can develop a more creative capitalism. If we can stretch the reach of market forces so that more people can make a profit or at least earn a living, serving people who are suffering from the great inequities. We can also press governments around the world to spend tax payer money in ways that better reflect the values of the people who pay the taxes. If we can find approaches that meet the needs of the poor in ways that generate profits for business and votes for politicians, we will have found a sustainable way to reduce inequity in the world. Now this task is open ended. It can never be finished, but a conscious effort to answer this challenge can change the world. I\\'m optimistic that we can do this. But I talk to skeptics who claim there is no hope. They say inequity has been with us since the beginning and will be with us until the end, because people just don\\'t care. I completely disagree. I believe we have more caring than we know what to do with. All of us here in this yard, at one time or another, have seen human tragedies that broke our heart. And yet we did nothing. Not because we don\\'t care, but because we didn\\'t know what to do. If we had known how to help we would have acted. The barrier to change is not too little caring. It is too much complexity. To turn caring into action, we need to see a problem, see a solution and see the impact. But complexity blocks all three steps. Even with the advent of the internet and 24 hour news, it is still a complex enterprise to get people to truly see the problems. When an airplane crashes, officials immediately call a press conference. They promise to investigate, determine the cause and prevent similar crashes in the futures. But if the officials were brutally honest, they would say, \"Of all the people in the world who died today from preventable causes, 1 half of 1 percent were on this plane.\". We\\'re determined to do everything possible to solve the problem that took the lives of 1 half of 1 percent. The problem is not just the plane crash but the millions of preventable deaths. We don\\'t read much about these deaths, the media covers what\\'s new and millions of people dying is nothing new. So it stays in the background where it\\'s easy to ignore. But even when we do see it or read about it, it\\'s difficult to keep our eye- eyes on the problem. It\\'s difficult to look at suffering if the situation is so complex that we don\\'t know how to help and so we look away. If we can really see a problem, which is the first step, we come to the second step. Cutting through the complexity to find a solution. Finding solutions is essential if we want to make the most of our caring. If we have clear and proven answers any time an organisation or an individual asks, \"How can I help?\", then we can get action. And we can make sure that none of the caring in the world is wasted. The complexity makes it hard to mark a path of action for everyone who cares and makes it hard for that caring to matter. Cutting through complexity to find solutions runs through 4 predictable stages: Determine a goal. Find the highest impact approach. Deliver the technology ideal for that approach and in the mean time use the best application of technology you already have. Whether it\\'s something sophisticated like a new drug or something simple like a bed net. The aids epidemic offers an example, the broad goal of course is to end the disease. The highest leverage approach is prevention, the ideal technology would be a vaccine that gives life long immunity with a single dose. So governments, drug companies and foundations are funding vaccine research. But their work is likely to take more than a decade. So in the mean time we have to work with what we have in hand and the best prevention approach we have now is getting people to avoid risky behavior. Pursuing that goal starts the 4 step cycle again. This is the pattern. The crucial thing is to never stop thinking and working. And never do what we did with malaria and tuberculosis in the 20th century. Which is to surrender to complexity and quit. The final step after seeing the problem and finding an approach, is to measure the impact of the work and to share that, success or failure, so that others can learn from the efforts. You have to have the statistics, of course, you have to be able to show for example that a program is vaccinating million more- millions more children. You have to be able to show for example a decline in the number of children dying from the diseases. This is essential not just to improve the program but also to help draw more investment from business and government But if you want to inspire people to participate, you have to show more than numbers. You have to convey the human impact of the work. So people can feel what saving a life means to the families affected. I remember going to the World Economic Forum some years back and sitting on a global health panel that was discussing ways to save millions of lives. Millions. Think of the thrill if you could save just one persons life, then multiply that by millions. Yet this was the most boring panel I had ever been on- [Laughter.] -ever. So boring that even I couldn\\'t stand it. What made that experience especially striking was that I had just come from an event where we were introducing version 13 of some piece of software, and we had people jumping and shouting with excitement. I love getting people excited about software, [Non-emergency siren in distant background.] But why can\\'t we generate even more excitement for saving lives. You can\\'t get people excited unless you can help them see and feel the impact. [Applause.] The way to do that is another complex question. Still, I\\'m optimistic. Yes inequity has been with us forever, but the new tools we have to cut through complexity have not been with us forever. They are new. They can help us make the most of our caring. And that\\'s why the future can be different from the past. The defining and ongoing innovations of this age, biotechnology, the personal computer and the internet. Give us a chance we\\'ve never had before. To end extreme poverty and end death from preventable disease. 60 years ago George Marshall came to this commencement and he announced a plan to assist the nations of post war Europe. He said, I quote \"I think one difficulty, is that the problem is one of such enormous complexity that the very massive facts presented to the public by press and radio, make it exceedingly difficult for the man in the street to reach a clear appraisement of the situation. It is virtually impossible, at this distance, to grasp at all the real significance of the situation.\". 30 years after Marshall made his address, which was 30 years ago, as my class graduated without me. Technology was emerging that would make the world smaller, more open, more visible, less distant. The emergence of low cost personal computers gave rise to a powerful network that has transformed opportunities for learning and communicating. The magical thing about this network is not just that it collapses distance and makes everyone your neighbour. It also dramatically increases the number of brilliant minds we can bring in to work together on the same problem. And it scales up the rate of potential innovation to a staggering degree. At the same time for every person who has access to this technology, 5 people don\\'t. That means many creative minds are left out of this discussion. Smart people with practical intelligence and relevant experience, who don\\'t have the technology to hone their talents or contribute their ideas to the world. We need as many people as possible to gain access to this technology, because these advances are triggering a revolution in human- in what human beings can do for one another. They are making it possible, not just for national governments, but for universities, corporations, small organisations and even individuals to see problems, see approaches and measure the impact of their efforts to address the hunger, poverty and desperation George Marshall spoke of 60 years ago. Members of the Harvard family, here in the yard is one of the great collections of intellectual talent in the world. For what purpose? There is no question that the faculty, the alumni, the students and the benefactors of Harvard have used their power to improve the lives of people here and around the world. But can we do more? Can Harvard dedicate its intellect to improving the lives of people who will never even hear its name. Let me make a request of the deans and professors, the intellectual leaders here at Harvard. As you hire new faculty, award tenure, review curriculum and determine degree requirements, please ask yourself, should our best minds be more dedicated to solving our biggest problems? Should Harvard encourage its faculty to take on the worlds worst inequities? [Applause.] Should Harvard students know about the depth of global poverty, the prevalence of world hunger, the scarcity of clean water, the girls kept out of school, the children who die from diseases we can cure? Should the worlds most privileged learn about the lives of the worlds least privileged? These are not rhetorical questions. [Applause.] You will answer with your policies My mother who was filled with pride the day I was admitted here, never stopped pressing me to do more for others. A few days before I was married she hosted a bridal event at which she read aloud a letter about marriage that she had written to Melinda. My mother was very ill with cancer at the time but she saw one more opportunity to deliver her message and at the close of the letter she said, \"From those to whom much is given, much is expected.\". [Applause.] When you consider what those of us here in this yard have been given in talent, privilege and opportunity, there is almost no limit to what the world has a right to expect from us. In line with the promise of this age, I want to exhort each of the graduates here to take on an issue, a complex problem, a deep inequity and become a specialist on it. If you make it the focus of your career that would be phenomenal. But you don\\'t have to do that to make an impact. For a few hours every week you can use the growing power of the internet to get informed, find others with the same interests, see the barriers and find ways to cut through them. Don\\'t let complexity stop you. Be active- activists. Take on big inequities. Be active- activists. Take on big inequities. I feel sure it will be one of the great experiences of your lives. You graduates are coming of age at an amazing time as you leave Harvard you have technology that members of my class never had. You have awareness of global inequity which we did not have. And with that awareness, you likely also have an informed conscience that will torment if you abandon these people whose lives you could change with modest effort. You have more than we had, you must start sooner and carry on longer. And I hope you will come back here to Harvard 30 years from now and reflect what you have done with your talent and your energy. I hope you will judge yourselves not on your professional accomplishments alone but also on how well you have addressed the worlds deepest inequities. On how well you treated people a world away, who have nothing in common with you but their humanity. Good luck. [Standing applause, one guy cheers.] Thank you Doctor Gates for that important message. You are an inspiration to us all and we thank you for being here today. Please stand and join me now as we sing Fair Harvard, the words are included in your programme. [Fair Harvard Hymn with marching band music.] [Drum roll then clapping.] On behalf of the Harvard Alumni Association I give a warm welcome and congratulations to the class of 2007. [Cheering and applause.] I hope you will return often to Cambridge and will remain engaged with our university. Through the many activities offered by the HAA and the Harvard Clubs around the world. In closing let me quickly add, this year Harvard is extending a warm welcome to the Cambridge Region Latin School as they celebrate their graduating senior class. This ceremony will be held right here, beginning at 6:30. Our remarkable operations crew will now be getting this space ready for that ceremony. [Laughter.] So it\\'s been great to have you all here. I hereby declare that the 2007 meeting of the Harvard Alumni Association is adjourned to be reconvened on June 5th 2008. Thank you all for coming. [Gavel knocks against wood.] [Applause and church bell sounds and marching band plays.] (Male commentator:) And lets see, we have just heard some very exciting talks. One by Derick Bach, one by Bill Gates. And another afternoon exercise come to the end. Tell me your impressions. (Female commentator:) Well Bill Gates speech was in keeping with president Clinton\\'s charge to the senior class yesterday. To go out, use the intellect, the intelligence, the education that you have had here at Harvard to make the world a better place. Bill Gates talked about his own journey from chairman of Microsoft to thinking about how to give back to the world. And his journey with his wife to discover that diseases are in fact eradicable in our lifetimes. And he and his wife are on a mission to, work to, eliminate the diseases of malaria, measles, rotavirus which as he says kills millions of people. Tuberculosis. He talked about the complexity of these sorts of problems and urged the graduates not to allow complexity to deter them. He likened his mission to the Mar- mission of the Marshall plan which George Marshall announced here at the Harvard commencement in 1947. And he urged the graduates to make the world a better place, even if it was only in their spare time. (Male commentator again:) And with that, ringing message, we bring to a close this annual afternoon exercises at Harvard Yard at the tercentenary theater. glad to have had you here and hope you have enjoyed it as much as all the people in this wonderful theater did. Thank you and until next year, farewell. ',\n",
       " \" [Applause] I'd like to thank you for leaving crazy person out of the description so I thought I try to think what is the most useful thing that I could but what could I say like that could actually helpful or useful to you in the future and I thought perhaps to tell the story of how I sort of came to be here how did some of these things happen and and maybe there's some lessons there because I often find myself wondering how did this happen so when I was young I I didn't really know what I was going to do we're not when I got older people kept asking me and and but then eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be would be really cool and the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Odyssey clock which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic and and that's really true if you think if you go back say 300 years the things that we take for granted today would be you'd be burned at the stake for you know being able to fly that's crazy being able to see over long distances being able to communicate having effectively with the internet a a group mind of sorts and having access to all the world's information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth this is the stuff that that really would be magic that would be considered magic in times past in fact I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times past they weren't even in the realm of magic so it actually goes goes beyond that so I thought well you know if if I can do some of those things basically if I can advanced technology then that that's like magic and I would be really cool and the the I was at sort of a slight existential crisis because I was trying to figure out what does it all mean like what's the purpose of things and I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the the knowledge of the world if we can do things that expand the scope and and scale of consciousness then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened and and that's really the only way forward so so it's like I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how how the economy works and you also need to built bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as as an individual if it's if it's a significant technology so I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries and that was in 95 and that's also when the internet started to happen and and I thought well I can either pursue this tech this technology where success maybe may not be one of the possible outcomes which is always tricky or participate in the Internet and and be part of it so I decided to drop out now as you unfortunately we're past graduation so I can't be accused of recommending that to you and so it's a did some internet stuff you know put a few things here and there what one of which was PayPal and I think maybe it's helpful to say one of the things that was important than in the creation of PayPal was whispers kind of how it started because initially the initial thought was with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services so if you have one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and and work smoothly and then we had like a little feature which was to do email payments and whenever we'd show that show the system off to someone would show the hard part which was the the agglomeration of financial services which was quite difficult to put together nobody was interested then we'd show people email payments which was actually quite easy and everybody was interested so that this is I think it's important to take feedback from your environment you know it's it you want to be as closed-loop as possible and so we focused on email payments and really try to make that work and and that's what really got things to take off but if we hadn't if we hadn't responded to what people said then we probably would not have been successful so it's important to look for things like that and and focus on them when when you when you see them and you're correct your your prior assumptions and then the going from PayPal I thought well what are some of the the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity it really wasn't from the perspective of what what's the rank or did best way to to make money which which is which is okay but it was really what I think is going to most affect the future humanity so the I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner if we don't solve that this century is the century where we're in deep trouble and then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make life multiplanetary so that's that that's that's the basis for that the latter is the basis force for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and SolarCity and and when I started SpaceX I initially I thought that well is there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company I wasn't that crazy but but then I thought well what is a way to increase NASA's budget that was actually my initial goal so I thought well if we do a low-cost mission to Mars and the COPE Amazo aces which would land seeds with with dehydrate would receive some dehydrated nutrient gel and you hydrate them upon landing and then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background and the the public tends to respond to presidents and superlatives and this would be the first life on Mars the farthest that life's ever traveled as far as we know and and I thought well that that would get people really excited and and and therefore increase with NASA's budget so so obviously the financial outcome from such a mission would probably be zero so anything better than that was on the upside and so I actually went to I went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM because that was the best deal and I can tell you it was very weird going there in 2000 late 2001 2002 going to the Russian rocket forces and saying I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets but you can keep the nuke that's a lot more and this that was 10 years ago I guess so they they I think they they thought I was crazy but but I did have money so that was that was okay and after making several trips to to Russia I came to conclusion that that actually my initial impression was was wrong about because my initial thought was well that that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond Earth and have a Mars base and that kind of thing but I can't Christian that that that was wrong in fact there's plenty of will particularly in the United States because the United States is a nation of explorers the people who came here from from other parts of the world I think the United States really a just a distillation of the spirit of human exploration so but but if people think it's impossible then or it's going to completely break the federal budget then they're not going to do it so after my third trip I said okay well what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and and started SpaceX and this list was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to what one friend made me sit down and watch a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up let me tell you he wasn't far wrong I think there was it was tough going there in the beginning because I'd never built anything physical I mean I'd both like little model rockets as a kid and that kind of thing but I never had a company that built in any physical said have to figure out how to how to do all these things and and bring together the right team of people and and and so we we did all that and and then failed three times it was tough tough going because thinking about a rocket is that the passing grade is a hundred percent and you don't get to actually test the rocket in the real environment that is going to be in so I think to the best analogy for for rocket engineering is it's like if you want to create a really pump complicated but a software you can't run the software as an integrated whole and you can't run it on the computer it's intended to run on but the first time you put it all together and write it on that computer it must run with no bugs that's that's basically the essence of it so we missed the mark there that the first launch I was picking up butts of rocket near the new launch scientist but sad and but we learned with with each success of flight and and were able to with eventually with the fourth flight in 2008 reach orbit and that was also with the last bit of money that we had so they thank goodness that that happened it I think this thing's both times to charm so that's we got the Falcon went orbit and then began to scale that up to to the Falcon 9 which is about an order of magnitude more thrust it's a around a million pounds of thrust and we managed to get that to orbit and then developed Dragon spacecraft which recently was able to dock and return to Earth from the space station that was thanks I was a white knuckled event so yeah it's a huge relief still can't quite believe it actually happened but but there's a lot more that must happen beyond this in order for humanity to become a spacefaring civilization and ultimately a multi-planet species and that's something I think it's it's it's vitally important and and I hope that that some of you will participate in that either at SpaceX or at other companies because it's just really one of the most important things for the preservation and extension of consciousness and it's worth noting as I'm sure people are aware that the earth has been around for four billion years and civilization at least in terms of having writing has been around for ten thousand years and that's being generous so it's it's really it's sort of a tenuous existence that that civilization and and consciousness as we know it is there's been on earth and I think I'm actually I'm actually fairly optimistic about the future of Earth so I don't want to I'd want to sort of people to have the wrong impression that I think we're all about to die I think I think well I think things will most likely be okay for a look for a long time on earth but not not for sure but most likely but even if it's if it's sort of 99% likely one a 1% chance it's still it's still worth spending a fair bit of effort to ensure that we have we've backed up the biosphere in a planetary redundancy if you will and and so I think I think it's really really quite important and in order to that there's a breakthrough that needs to occur which is to create a rapidly and completely reusable transport system to Mars which which is one of those things that's right on the borderline of of impossible but that that's sort of the thing that we're we're going to try to achieve there with with with SpaceX and then on the on the on the Tesla front the goal with Tesla was really to try to show that what what electric cars can do because people had the wrong impression we had to change people's perception of an electric vehicle because they used to think of it as something that was slow and ugly and had low range can like a golf cart and whoop so that's why we created the Tesla Roadster to show that you can be fast attractive and and long range and it's amazing how even though you can show that something works on paper you know and the calculations are very clear until you actually have the physical object and they can they can drive it it doesn't really sink in for people and so that that I think is is something worth noting if you're going to create a company the first thing you should try to do is create a working prototype your everything everything looks great on PowerPoint you can make anything work on PowerPoint but if you have an actual demonstration article even if it's in primitive form that's much much more effective for convincing people so so we made the Tesla Roadster and now we're coming out soon with the Model S which is a four-door sedan because after we made the Tesla Roadster people said oh sure sure we always knew you could make a car like that it's an expensive car and it's low volume and it's small and all that but you can make a real car like okay fine you're gonna make that two so that that's coming out soon and yeah so that that's that that's that's the I think the the word where things are and and and hopefully that there are some lessons to be to be drawn there but I I think the overarching point I want to make is that you guys are the magicians of the 21st century you know don't like anything hold you back imagination is the limit and go out there and create some magic thank you [Applause] I'd like to thank you for leaving crazy person out of the description so I thought I try to think what is the most useful thing that I could what could I say like that could actually helpful or useful to you in the future and I thought perhaps tell the story of how I sort of came to be here how did some of these

only way forward so so it's like I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how how the economy works and you also need to built bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as as an individual if it's if it's a significant technology so I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that I could serve as an alternative to batteries and that was in 95 and that's also when the internet started to happen and and it I I thought well I can either pursue this tech this technology where success may be may not be one of the possible outcomes which is always tricky or participate in the internet and and be part of it so I decided to drop out now is the you unfortunately we're past graduation so I can't be accused of recommending that to you and so did some internet stuff you know they've put a few things here and there what one of which is PayPal and I think maybe it's helpful to say one of the things that was important than in the creation of PayPal was whiskey was kind of how it started because initially the initial thought was with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services so if you have one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and and work smoothly and then we had like a little feature which was through email payments and whenever we'd show that show the system off to someone would show the hard part which was the the agglomeration of financial services which was quite difficult to \",\n",
       " ' throughout my time at Wyoming area I have pursued every leadership opportunity available to me in addition to being a member of student council since I was a freshman my classmates have also elected me class president in the past four years which has been my greatest honor and I would like to thank you all for that one final time it really means a lot however at our school the title of class president could more accurately a class party planner and student councils main obligation is to paint signs every week the spikes will be outstanding people in our school the lack of a real student government combined with the authoritative attitude that a few teachers administrators and board members have prevent students are truly developing as leaders hopefully this will change ',\n",
       " ' This program is brought to you by Stanford University. Please visit us at stanford.edu Thank You. I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. Truth be told I never graduated from college and this is the closest I\\'ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That\\'s it. No big deal. Just three stories. The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: \"We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?\" They said: \"Of course.\" My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life. And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents\\' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn\\'t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn\\'t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting. It wasn\\'t all romantic. I didn\\'t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends\\' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5 cent deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example: Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn\\'t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can\\'t capture, and I found it fascinating. None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it\\'s likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later. Again, you can\\'t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Beleiveing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart Even when it leads you off the well worn path, and that will make all the difference. My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation the Macintosh a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating. I really didn\\'t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over. I didn\\'t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple\\'s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together. I\\'m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn\\'t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don\\'t lose faith. I\\'m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You\\'ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven\\'t found it yet, keep looking. Don\\'t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you\\'ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don\\'t settle. My third story is about death. When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: \"If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you\\'ll most certainly be right.\" It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: \"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?\" And whenever the answer has been \"No\" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. Remembering that I\\'ll be dead soon is the most important tool I\\'ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn\\'t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor\\'s code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you\\'d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes. I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and thankfully I\\'m fine now. This was the closest I\\'ve been to facing death, and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don\\'t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life\\'s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true. Your time is limited, so don\\'t waste it living someone else\\'s life. Don\\'t be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people\\'s thinking. Don\\'t let the noise of others\\' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960\\'s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools, and great notions. Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: \"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.\" It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. Thank you all very much.',\n",
       " \" MIT thank you congratulations class of seventeen I especially want to thank chairman Maillard president rive distinguished faculty trustees and members of the class of 1967 it's a privilege to be with you today with your families and your friends on such an amazing important day MIT and Apple share so much we both love hard problems we love the search for new ideas and we especially love finding those ideas the really big ones the ones that can change the world I know MIT has a proud tradition of pranks or as you would call them hacks and you've had pulled off some pretty great ones over the years I'll never figure out how MIT students since that Mars rover to the Krusty Oval or put a propeller beanie on the Great Dome or how you've obviously taken over the president's Twitter account I can tell college students are behind it because most of the tweets happen at 3 a.m. I'm really happy to be here today is about celebration and you have so much to be proud of as you leave here to start the next leg of your journey in life there will be days where you will ask yourself where is all this going what is the purpose what is my purpose I'll be honest I asked myself that same question and it took me nearly 15 years to answer it maybe by talking about my journey today I can save you some time the struggle for me started early on in high school I thought I'd discover my life's purpose when I could answer that age-old question what do you want to be when you grow up nope in college I thought I would discover it when I could answer what's your major not quiet I thought that maybe I discover it when I found a good job then I thought I just needed to get a few promotions that didn't work either I kept convincing myself that it was just over the horizon around the next corner nothing worked and it was really tearing me apart part of me kept pushing ahead to the next achievement and the other part kept asking is this all there is I went to grad school at Duke looking for the answer I tried meditation I sought guidance and religion I read great philosophers and authors and in a moment of youthful and discretion I might even have experimented with a Windows PC and obviously that didn't work after countless twists and turns at last 20 years ago my search brought me to Apple at the time the company was struggling to survive Steve Jobs had just returned to Apple and had launched the think different campaign he wanted to empower the crazy ones The Misfits the rebels the troublemakers the round pegs in the square holes to do their best work if we could just do that Steve knew we could really change the world before that moment I had never met a leader with such passion or encountered a company with such a clear and compelling purpose to serve humanity it was just that simple serve humanity and it was in that moment after 15 years of surging something clicked I finally felt aligned aligned with a company that brought together challenging cutting-edge work with a higher purpose aligned with a leader who believed that technology which didn't exist yet could reinvent tomorrow's world aligned with myself and my own deep need to serve something greater of course at that moment I didn't know all of that I was just grateful to have that psychological burden lifted but with the help of hindsight my breakthrough makes a lot more sense I was never going to find my purpose working someplace without a clear sense of purpose of its own Steven Apple freed me to throw my whole self into my work to embrace their mission and make it my own how can I serve humanity this is life's biggest and most important question when you work towards something greater than yourself you find meaning you find purpose so the question I hope you will carry forward from here is how will you serve humanity the good news is since you're here today you're already on a great track at MIT you've learned how much power science and technology had to change the world for the better thanks to discoveries made right here billions of people are leading healthier more productive more fulfilling lives and if we are ever going to solve some of the hardest problems still facing the world today everything from cancer to climate change to educational inequality then technology will help us do it but technology alone isn't the solution and sometimes it's even part of the problem last year I had the chance to meet with Pope Francis it was the most incredible meeting of my life this is a man who has spent more time comforting the afflicted in slums than he has with heads of state this may surprise you but he knew an unbelievable amount about technology it was obvious to me that he had thought deeply about it its opportunities its risks its morality what he said to me at that meeting what he preached really was on a topic we care a lot about it but he expressed a shared concern in a powerful new way never has humanity had such power over itself yet nothing ensures that it will be used wisely he has said technology today is integral to almost all aspects of our lives and most of the time it's a force for good and yet the potential adverse consequences are spreading faster and cutting deeper than ever before threats to our security threats to our privacy fake news and social media that becomes anti-social sometimes the very technology that is meant to connect us divides us technology is capable of doing great things but it doesn't want to do great things it doesn't want anything that part takes all of us it takes our values in our commitment to our families and our neighbors and our communities our love of beauty and belief that all of our fates are interconnected our decency our kindness I'm not worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans I'm more concerned about people thinking like computers without values or compassion without concern for consequences that is what we need you to help us guard against because of silence because if science is a search in the darkness then the humanities are a candle shows us where we've been and the danger that lies ahead as Steve once said technology alone is not enough it is technology married with the liberal arts married with the humanities that make our hearts a when you keep people at the center of what you do it can have an enormous impact it means an iPhone that allows a blind person to run a marathon it means an Apple watch that catches a heart condition before it becomes a heart attack it means an iPad that helps a child with autism connect with his or her world in short it means technology infused with your values making progress possible for everyone whatever you do in your life and whatever we do at Apple we must infuse it with the humanity that each of us is born with that responsibility is immense but so is the opportunity I'm optimistic because I believe in your generation your passion your journey to serve humanity we are all counting on you there is so much out there conspiring to make you cynical the Internet has enabled so much and empowered so many but it can also be a place where basic rules of decency are suspended and pettiness and negativity thrive don't let that noise knock you off course don't get caught up in the trivial aspects of life don't listen to trolls for God's sake don't become one measure your impact on humanity not in likes but in the lives you touch not in popularity but in the people you serve I found that my life got bigger when I stopped caring what other people thought about me you will find yours will to stay focused on what really matters there will be times when you resolve to serve humanity will be tested be prepared people will try to convince you that you should keep your empathy out of your career don't accept this false premise at a shareholders meeting a few years of back someone questioned apples investment and focus on the environment he asked me to pledge that Apple would only invest in green initiatives that could be justified with the return on investment I tried to be diplomatic I pointed out that Apple does many things like accessibility features for those with disabilities that don't rely on an ROI we do these things because they're the right thing to do and protecting the environment is a critical example he wouldn't let it go and I got my blood up so I told him if you can't accept our position you shouldn't own Apple stock when your condensed that your cause is right have the courage to take a stand if you see a problem or an injustice recognize that no one will fix it but you as you go forward today use your minds and hands and your hearts to build something bigger than yourselves always remember there is no idea bigger than this as dr. Martin Luther King said all life is interrelated we are all bound together into a single garment of destiny if you keep that idea at the forefront of all that you do if you choose to live your lives at that intersection between technology and the people it serves if you strive to create the best give the best do the best for everyone not just for some then today all of humanity has good cause for hope thank you very much and congratulations class of 2017 [Applause]\"]"

      " President Faust, Board of Overseers, faculty, alumni, friends, proud parents, members of the ad board, and graduates of the greatest university in the world, I'm honored to be with you today because, let's face it, you accomplished something I never could. If I get through this speech, it'll be the first time I actually finish something at Harvard. Class of 2017, congratulations! I'm an unlikely speaker, not just because I dropped out, but because we're technically in the same generation. We walked this yard less than a decade apart, studied the same ideas and slept through the same Ec10 lectures. We may have taken different paths to get here, especially if you came all the way from the Quad, but today I want to share what I've learned about our generation and the world we're building together. But first, the last couple of days have brought back a lot of good memories. How many of you remember exactly what you were doing when you got that email telling you that you got into Harvard? I was playing Civilization and I ran downstairs, got my dad, and for some reason, his reaction was to video me opening the email. That could have been a really sad video. I swear getting into Harvard is still the thing my parents are most proud of me for. What about your first lecture at Harvard? Mine was Computer Science 121 with the incredible Harry Lewis. I was late so I threw on a t-shirt and didn't realize until afterwards it was inside out and backwards with my tag sticking out the front. I couldn't figure out why no one would talk to me -- except one guy, KX Jin, he just went with it. We ended up doing our problem sets together, and now he runs a big part of Facebook. And that, Class of 2017, is why you should be nice to people. But my best memory from Harvard was meeting Priscilla. I had just launched this prank website Facemash, and the ad board wanted to \"see me\". Everyone thought I was going to get kicked out. My parents came to help me pack. My friends threw me a going away party. As luck would have it, Priscilla was at that party with her friend. We met in line for the bathroom in the Pfoho Belltower, and in what must be one of the all time romantic lines, I said: \"I'm going to get kicked out in three days, so we need to go on a date quickly.\" Actually, any of you graduating can use that line. I didn't end up getting kicked out -- I did that to myself. Priscilla and I started dating. And, you know, that movie made it seem like Facemash was so important to creating Facebook. It wasn't. But without Facemash I wouldn't have met Priscilla, and she's the most important person in my life, so you could say it was the most important thing I built in my time here. We've all started lifelong friendships here, and some of us even families. That's why I'm so grateful to this place. Thanks, Harvard. Today I want to talk about purpose. But I'm not here to give you the standard commencement about finding your purpose. We're millennials. We'll try to do that instinctively. Instead, I'm here to tell you finding your purpose isn't enough. The challenge for our generation is creating a world where everyone has a sense of purpose. One of my favorite stories is when John F Kennedy visited the NASA space center, he saw a janitor carrying a broom and he walked over and asked what he was doing. The janitor responded: \"Mr. President, I'm helping put a man on the moon\". Purpose is that sense that we are part of something bigger than ourselves, that we are needed, that we have something better ahead to work for. Purpose is what creates true happiness. You're graduating at a time when this is especially important. When our parents graduated, purpose reliably came from your job, your church, your community. But today, technology and automation are eliminating many jobs. Membership in communities is declining. Many people feel disconnected and depressed, and are trying to fill a void. As I've traveled around, I've sat with children in juvenile detention and opioid addicts, who told me their lives could have turned out differently if they just had something to do, an after school program or somewhere to go. I've met factory workers who know their old jobs aren't coming back and are trying to find their place. To keep our society moving forward, we have a generational challenge -- to not only create new jobs, but create a renewed sense of purpose. I remember the night I launched Facebook from my little dorm in Kirkland House. I went to Noch's with my friend KX. I remember telling him I was excited to connect the Harvard community, but one day someone would connect the whole world. The thing is, it never even occurred to me that someone might be us. We were just college kids. We didn't know anything about that. There were all these big technology companies with resources. I just assumed one of them would do it. But this idea was so clear to us -- that all people want to connect. So we just kept moving forward, day by day. I know a lot of you will have your own stories just like this. A change in the world that seems so clear you're sure someone else will do it. But they won't. You will. But it's not enough to have purpose yourself. You have to create a sense of purpose for others. I found that out the hard way. You see, my hope was never to build a company, but to make an impact. And as all these people started joining us, I just assumed that's what they cared about too, so I never explained what I hoped we'd build. A couple years in, some big companies wanted to buy us. I didn't want to sell. I wanted to see if we could connect more people. We were building the first News Feed, and I thought if we could just launch this, it could change how we learn about the world. Nearly everyone else wanted to sell. Without a sense of higher purpose, this was the startup dream come true. It tore our company apart. After one tense argument, an advisor told me if I didn't agree to sell, I would regret the decision for the rest of my life. Relationships were so frayed that within a year or so every single person on the management team was gone. That was my hardest time leading Facebook. I believed in what we were doing, but I felt alone. And worse, it was my fault. I wondered if I was just wrong, an imposter, a 22 year-old kid who had no idea how the world worked. Now, years later, I understand that *is* how things work with no sense of higher purpose. It's up to us to create it so we can all keep moving forward together. Today I want to talk about three ways to create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose: by taking on big meaningful projects together, by redefining equality so everyone has the freedom to pursue purpose, and by building community across the world. First, let's take on big meaningful projects. Our generation will have to deal with tens of millions of jobs replaced by automation like self-driving cars and trucks. But we have the potential to do so much more together. Every generation has its defining works. More than 300,000 people worked to put a man on the moon \\'96 including that janitor. Millions of volunteers immunized children around the world against polio. Millions of more people built the Hoover dam and other great projects. These projects didn't just provide purpose for the people doing those jobs, they gave our whole country a sense of pride that we could do great things. Now it's our turn to do great things. I know, you're probably thinking: I don't know how to build a dam, or get a million people involved in anything. But let me tell you a secret: no one does when they begin. Ideas don't come out fully formed. They only become clear as you work on them. You just have to get started. If I had to understand everything about connecting people before I began, I never would have started Facebook. Movies and pop culture get this all wrong. The idea of a single eureka moment is a dangerous lie. It makes us feel inadequate since we haven't had ours. It prevents people with seeds of good ideas from getting started. Oh, you know what else movies get wrong about innovation? No one writes math formulas on glass. That's not a thing. It's good to be idealistic. But be prepared to be misunderstood. Anyone working on a big vision will get called crazy, even if you end up right. Anyone working on a complex problem will get blamed for not fully understanding the challenge, even though it's impossible to know everything upfront. Anyone taking initiative will get criticized for moving too fast, because there's always someone who wants to slow you down. In our society, we often don't do big things because we're so afraid of making mistakes that we ignore all the things wrong today if we do nothing. The reality is, anything we do will have issues in the future. But that can't keep us from starting. So what are we waiting for? It's time for our generation-defining public works. How about stopping climate change before we destroy the planet and getting millions of people involved manufacturing and installing solar panels? How about curing all diseases and asking volunteers to track their health data and share their genomes? Today we spend 50x more treating people who are sick than we spend finding cures so people don't get sick in the first place. That makes no sense. We can fix this. How about modernizing democracy so everyone can vote online, and personalizing education so everyone can learn? These achievements are within our reach. Let's do them all in a way that gives everyone in our society a role. Let's do big things, not only to create progress, but to create purpose. So taking on big meaningful projects is the first thing we can do to create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose. The second is redefining equality to give everyone the freedom they need to pursue purpose. Many of our parents had stable jobs throughout their careers. Now we're all entrepreneurial, whether we're starting projects or finding or role. And that's great. Our culture of entrepreneurship is how we create so much progress. Now, an entrepreneurial culture thrives when it's easy to try lots of new ideas. Facebook wasn't the first thing I built. I also built games, chat systems, study tools and music players. I'm not alone. JK Rowling got rejected 12 times before publishing Harry Potter. Even Beyonce had to make hundreds of songs to get Halo. The greatest successes come from having the freedom to fail. But today, we have a level of wealth inequality that hurts everyone. When you don't have the freedom to take your idea and turn it into a historic enterprise, we all lose. Right now our society is way over-indexed on rewarding success and we don't do nearly enough to make it easy for everyone to take lots of shots. Let's face it. There is something wrong with our system when I can leave here and make billions of dollars in 10 years while millions of students can't afford to pay off their loans, let alone start a business. Look, I know a lot of entrepreneurs, and I don't know a single person who gave up on starting a business because they might not make enough money. But I know lots of people who haven't pursued dreams because they didn't have a cushion to fall back on if they failed. We all know we don't succeed just by having a good idea or working hard. We succeed by being lucky too. If I had to support my family growing up instead of having time to code, if I didn't know I'd be fine if Facebook didn't work out, I wouldn't be standing here today. If we're honest, we all know how much luck we've had. Every generation expands its definition of equality. Previous generations fought for the vote and civil rights. They had the New Deal and Great Society. Now it's our time to define a new social contract for our generation. We should have a society that measures progress not just by economic metrics like GDP, but by how many of us have a role we find meaningful. We should explore ideas like universal basic income to give everyone a cushion to try new things. We\\'92re going to change jobs many times, so we need affordable childcare to get to work and healthcare that aren't tied to one company. We're all going to make mistakes, so we need a society that focuses less on locking us up or stigmatizing us. And as technology keeps changing, we need to focus more on continuous education throughout our lives.\\ And yes, giving everyone the freedom to pursue purpose isn't free. People like me should pay for it. Many of you will do well and you should too. That's why Priscilla and I started the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and committed our wealth to promoting equal opportunity. These are the values of our generation. It was never a question of if we were going to do this. The only question was when. Millennials are already one of the most charitable generations in history. In one year, three of four US millennials made a donation and seven out of ten raised money for charity. But it's not just about money. You can also give time. I promise you, if you take an hour or two a week -- that's all it takes to give someone a hand, to help them reach their potential. Maybe you think that's too much time. I used to. When Priscilla graduated from Harvard she became a teacher, and before she'd do education work with me, she told me I needed to teach a class. I complained: \"Well, I'm kind of busy. I'm running this company.\" But she insisted, so I taught a middle school program on entrepreneurship at the local Boys and Girls Club. I taught them lessons on product development and marketing, and they taught me what it's like feeling targeted for your race and having a family member in prison. I shared stories from my time in school, and they shared their hope of one day going to college too. For five years now, I\\'92ve been having dinner with those kids every month. One of them threw me and Priscilla our first baby shower. And next year they\\'92re going to college. Every one of them. First in their families. We can all make time to give someone a hand. Let's give everyone the freedom to pursue their purpose -- not only because it's the right thing to do, but because when more people can turn their dreams into something great, we're all better for it. Purpose doesn't only come from work. The third way we can create a sense of purpose for everyone is by building community. And when our generation says \"everyone\", we mean everyone in the world. Quick show of hands: how many of you are from another country? Now, how many of you are friends with one of these folks? Now we're talking. We have grown up connected.\\ In a survey asking millennials around the world what defines our identity, the most popular answer wasn't nationality, religion or ethnicity, it was \"citizen of the world\". That's a big deal. Every generation expands the circle of people we consider \"one of us\". For us, it now encompasses the entire world. We understand the great arc of human history bends towards people coming together in ever greater numbers -- from tribes to cities to nations -- to achieve things we couldn't on our own. We get that our greatest opportunities are now global -- we can be the generation that ends poverty, that ends disease. We get that our greatest challenges need global responses too -- no country can fight climate change alone or prevent pandemics. Progress now requires coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community. But we live in an unstable time. There are people left behind by globalization across the world. It's hard to care about people in other places if we don't feel good about our lives here at home. There's pressure to turn inwards. This is the struggle of our time. The forces of freedom, openness and global community against the forces of authoritarianism, isolationism and nationalism. Forces for the flow of knowledge, trade and immigration against those who would slow them down. This is not a battle of nations, it's a battle of ideas. There are people in every country for global connection and good people against it. This isn't going to be decided at the UN either. It's going to happen at the local level, when enough of us feel a sense of purpose and stability in our own lives that we can open up and start caring about everyone. The best way to do that is to start building local communities right now. We all get meaning from our communities. Whether our communities are houses or sports teams, churches or music groups, they give us that sense we are part of something bigger, that we are not alone; they give us the strength to expand our horizons. That's why it's so striking that for decades, membership in all kinds of groups has declined as much as one-quarter. That's a lot of people who now need to find purpose somewhere else. But I know we can rebuild our communities and start new ones because many of you already are. I met Agnes Igoye, who's graduating today. Where are you, Agnes? She spent her childhood navigating conflict zones in Uganda, and now she trains thousands of law enforcement officers to keep communities safe. I met Kayla Oakley and Niha Jain, graduating today, too. Stand up. Kayla and Niha started a non-profit that connects people suffering from illnesses with people in their communities willing to help. I met David Razu Aznar, graduating from the Kennedy School today. David, stand up. He's a former city councilor who successfully led the battle to make Mexico City the first Latin American city to pass marriage equality -- even before San Francisco. This is my story too. A student in a dorm room, connecting one community at a time, and keeping at it until one day we connect the whole world. Change starts local. Even global changes start small -- with people like us. In our generation, the struggle of whether we connect more, whether we achieve our biggest opportunities, comes down to this -- your ability to build communities and create a world where every single person has a sense of purpose. Class of 2017, you are graduating into a world that needs purpose. It's up to you to create it. Now, you may be thinking: can I really do this? Remember when I told you about that class I taught at the Boys and Girls Club? One day after class I was talking to them about college, and one of my top students raised his hand and said he wasn't sure he could go because he's undocumented. He didn't know if they'd let him in. Last year I took him out to breakfast for his birthday. I wanted to get him a present, so I asked him and he started talking about students he saw struggling and said \"You know, I'd really just like a book on social justice.\" I was blown away. Here's a young guy who has every reason to be cynical. He didn't know if the country he calls home -- the only one he's known -- would deny him his dream of going to college. But he wasn't feeling sorry for himself. He wasn't even thinking of himself. He has a greater sense of purpose, and he's going to bring people along with him. It says something about our current situation that I can't even say his name because I don't want to put him at risk. But if a high school senior who doesn't know what the future holds can do his part to move the world forward, then we owe it to the world to do our part too. Before you walk out those gates one last time, as we sit in front of Memorial Church, I am reminded of a prayer, Mi Shebeirach, that I say whenever I face a challenge, that I sing to my daughter thinking about her future when I tuck her into bed. It goes: \"May the source of strength, who blessed the ones before us, help us *find the courage* to make our lives a blessing.\" I hope you find the courage to make your life a blessing. Congratulations, Class of '17! Good luck out there. \n",

      " Class of 2009! I don't think I heard you. Class of 2009! First I'd like you to stand up, wave and cheer your supportive family and friends! I'm sure you can find them out there. Show your love! It is a great honor for me to be here today. Now wait a second. I know: that's such a cliche? You're thinking: every graduation speaker says that -- It's a great honor. But, in my case, it really is so deeply true -- being here is more special and more personal for me than most of you know. I'd like to tell you why. A long time ago, in this cold September of 1962, there was a Steven's co-op at this very university. That co-op had a kitchen with a ceiling that had been cleaned by student volunteers probably every decade or so. Picture a college girl named Gloria, climbing up high on a ladder, struggling to clean that filthy ceiling. Standing on the floor, a young boarder named Carl was admiring the view. And that's how they met. They were my parents, so I suppose you could say I'm a direct result of that kitchen chemistry experiment, right here at Michigan. My Mom is here with us today, and we should probably go find the spot and put a plaque up on the ceiling that says: \"Thanks Mom and Dad!\" Everyone in my family went here at Michigan: me, my brother, my Mom and Dad -- all of us. My Dad actually got the quantity discount: all three and a half of his degrees are from here. His Ph.D. was in Communication Science because they thought Computers were just a passing fad. When he earned it 44 years ago. He and Mom made a big sacrifice for that. They argued at times over pennies, while raising my newborn brother. Mom typed my Dad's dissertation by hand. Kind of ironic given it was a computer science dissertation. This velvet hood I'm wearing, this was my Dad's. This diploma, just like the one you're about to get, this was my Dad's. And my underwear... oh never mind. Sorry. My father's father worked in the Chevy plant in Flint, Michigan. He was an assembly line worker. He drove his two children here to Ann Arbor, and told them: That is where you're going to go to college. I know it sounds funny now. Both of his kids did graduate from Michigan. That was the American dream. His daughter, Beverly, is with us today. My Grandpa used to carry an \"Alley Oop\" hammer -- a heavy iron pipe with a hunk of lead melted on the end. The workers made them during the sit-down strikes to protect themselves. When I was growing up, we used that hammer whenever we needed to pound a stake or something into the ground. It is wonderful that most people don't need to carry a heavy blunt object for protection anymore. But just in case, I brought it with me. Al right... My Dad became a professor at... Michigan State, and I was an incredibly lucky boy. A professor's life is pretty flexible, and he was able to spend oodles of time raising me. Could there be a better upbringing than university brat? What I'm trying to tell you is that this is WAY more than just a homecoming for me. It's not easy for me to express how proud I am to be here, with my Mom, my brother and my wife Lucy, and with all of you, at this amazing institution that is responsible for my very existence. I am thrilled for all of you, and I'm thrilled for your families and friends, as all of us join the great, big Michigan family I feel I've been a part of all of my life. What I'm also trying to tell you is that I know exactly what it feels like to be sitting in your seat, listening to some old gasbag give a long-winded commencement speech. Don't worry. I'll be brief. I have a story about following dreams. Or maybe more accurately, it's a story about finding a path to make those dreams real. You know what it's like to wake up in the middle of the night with a vivid dream? And you know how, if you don't have a pencil and pad by the bed, it will be completely gone the next morning? Well, I had one of those dreams when I was 23. When I suddenly woke up, I was thinking: what if we could download the whole web, and just keep the links and... I grabbed a pen and started writing! Sometimes it is important to wake up and stop dreaming. I spent the middle of that night scribbling out the details and convincing myself it would work. Soon after, I told my advisor, Terry Winograd, it would take a couple of weeks to download the web -- he nodded knowingly, fully aware it would take much longer but wise enough to not tell me. The optimism of youth is often underrated! Amazingly, At that time I had no thought of building a search engine. The idea wasn't even on the radar. But, much later we happened upon a better way of ranking and we made a really great search engine, and Google was born. When a really great dream shows up, grab it! When I was here at Michigan, I had actually been taught how to make dreams real! I know it sounds funny, but that is what I learned in a summer camp converted into a training program called Leadershape. Yeh, we got a few out there. Their slogan is to have a \"healthy disregard for the impossible\". That program encouraged me to pursue a crazy idea at the time: I wanted to build a personal rapid transit system on campus to replace the buses. Yeh, you're still working on that, I hear. It was a futuristic way of solving our transportation problem. I still think a lot about transportation -- you never loose a dream, it just incubates as a hobby. Many things that people labor hard to do now, like cooking, cleaning, and driving will require much less human time in the future. That is, if we \"have a healthy disregard for the impossible\" and actually build new solutions. I think it is often easier to make progress on mega-ambitious dreams. I know that sounds completely nuts. But, since no one else is crazy enough to do it, you have little competition. In fact, there are so few people this crazy that I feel like I know them all by first name. They all travel as if they are pack dogs and stick to each other like glue. The best people want to work the big challenges. That is what happened with Google. Our mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. How can that not get you excited? But we almost didn't start Google because my co-founder Sergey and I were too worried about dropping out of our Ph.D. program. None of you have that issue, it seems. You are probably on the right track if you feel like a sidewalk worm during a rainstorm! That is about how we felt after we maxed out three credit cards buying hard disks off the back of a truck. That was actually the first hardware for Google. Parents and friends: more credit cards always help. What is the one sentence summary of how you change the world? Always work hard on something uncomfortably exciting! As a Ph.D. student, I actually had three projects I wanted to work on. Thank goodness my advisor said, \"why don't you work on the web for a while\". He gave me some seriously good advice because the web was really growing with people and activity, even in 1995! Technology and especially the internet can really help you be lazy. Lazy? What I mean is a group of three people can write software that then millions can use and enjoy. Can three people answer the phone a million times? Find the leverage in the world, so you can be more lazy! Overall, I know it seems like the world is crumbling out there, but it is actually a great time in your life to get a little crazy, follow your curiosity, and be ambitious about it. Don't give up on your dreams. The world needs you all! So here's my final story: On a day like today, you might feel exhilarated — like you've just been shot out of a cannon at the circus -- and even invincible. Don't ever forget that incredible feeling. But also: always remember that the moments we have with friends and family, the chances we have to do things that might make a big difference in the world, or even to make a small difference to someone you love — all those wonderful chances that life gives us, life also takes away. It can happen fast, and a whole lot sooner than you think. In late March 1996, soon after I had moved to Stanford for grad school, my Dad had difficultly breathing and drove to the hospital. Two months later, he died. I was completely devastated. Many years later, after a startup, after falling in love, and after so many of life's adventures, I found myself thinking about my Dad. Lucy and I were far away in a steaming hot village walking through narrow streets. There were wonderful friendly people everywhere, but it was a desperately poor place -- people used the bathroom inside and it flowed out into the open gutter and straight into the river. We touched a boy with a limp leg, the result of paralysis from polio. Lucy and I were in rural India -- one of the few places where Polio still exists. Polio is transmitted fecal to oral, usually through filthy water. Well, my Dad had Polio. He went on a trip to Tennessee in the first grade and caught it. He was hospitalized for two months and had to be transported by military DC-3 back home -- his first flight. My Dad wrote, \"Then, I had to stay in bed for over a year, before I started back to school\". That is actually a quote from his fifth grade autobiography. My Dad had difficulty breathing his whole life, and the complications of Polio are what took him from us too soon. He would have been very upset that Polio still persists even though we have a vaccine. He would have been equally upset that back in India we had polio virus on our shoes from walking through the contaminated gutters that spread the disease. We were spreading the virus with every footstep, right under beautiful kids playing everywhere. The world is on the verge of eliminating polio, with 328 people infected so far. Let's get it done soon. Perhaps one of you will do that. My Dad was valedictorian of the Flint Mandeville High School class of 1956 of about 90 kids. I happened across his graduating speech recently, and it blew me away. 53 years ago at his graduation my Dad said: \"...we are entering a changing world, one of automation and employment change where education is an economic necessity. We will have increased periods of time to do as we wish, as our work week and retirement age continue to decline... (Or we wish that were true....) We shall take part in, or witness, developments in science, medicine, and industry that we can only dream of today. ... It is said that the future of any nation can be determined by the care and preparation given to its youth. If all the youths of America were as fortunate in securing an education as we have been, then the future of the United States would be even more bright than it is today.\" If my Dad was alive today, the thing I think he would be most happy about is that Lucy and I have a baby in the hopper. Yeh, let's cheer Lucy. I think he would have been annoyed that I hadn't gotten my Ph.D. yet (thanks, Michigan!). Dad was so full of insights, of excitement about new things, to this day, I often wonder what he would think about some new development. If he were here today -- well, it would be one of the best days of his life. He'd be like a kid in a candy store. For a day, he'd be young again. Many of us are fortunate enough to be here with family. Some of us have dear friends and family to go home to. And who knows, perhaps some of you, like Lucy and I, are dreaming of future families of your own. Just like me, your families brought you here, and you brought them here. Please keep them close and remember: they are what really matters in life. Thanks, Mom; Thanks, Lucy. And thank you, all, very much. \n",

      " President Bach, former president Rudenstine, incoming president Faust, members of the Harvard corporation and the board of overseers. Members of the faculty, parents and especially the graduates. I've been waiting more than 30 years to say this. Dad I always told you I'd come back and get my degree. [Applause and some laughter.] I wanna thank Harvard for this honour. I'll be changing my job next year and it will be nice to finally have a college degree on my resume. [Laughter.] I applaud the graduates for taking a much more direct route to your degrees. From our- my part I'm just happy that the Crimson called me Harvard's most successful drop out. I guess that makes me valedictorian of my own special class. I did the best of everyone who failed. [Laughter.] But I also want to be recognised as the guy who got Steve Balmer to drop out of business school. [Laughter and then also applause.] I'm a bad influence. That's why I was invited to speak at your graduation. If I'd spoken at your orientation fewer of you might be here today. [Laughter then also applause.] Harvard was a phenomenal experience for me. Academic life was fascinating. I used to sit in on lots of classes that I hadn't even signed up for. And dorm life was terrific. I lived up at Radcliffe, in Courier House. [Cheering.] There were always a lot of people in my dorm room late at night discussing things, because everyone knew that I didn't worry about getting up in the morning. [Laughter.] That's how I came to be the leader of the antisocial group. We clunged each other as a way of validating our rejection of all those social people. Radcliffe was a great place to live. There were more women up there and most of the guys were math-science types. The combination offered me the best odds, if you know what I mean. [Laughing.] That's where I learned the sad lesson that improving your odds doesn't guarantee you success. [Laughing.] One of my biggest memories of Harvard came in January 1975. When I made a call from Courier House to a company in Albuquerque, New Mexico, that had begun making the worlds first personal computer. I offered to sell them software. I worried they would realise I was just a student in a dorm and hang up on me. Instead they said, we're not quite ready, come see us in a month. Which was a good thing because we hadn't written the software yet. [Laughing.] From that moment I worked day and night on the extra credit project that marked the end of my college education and the beginning of a remarkable journey with Microsoft. What I remember above all about Harvard, was being in the midst of so much energy and intelligence. It could be exhilarating, intimidating, sometimes even discouraging but always challenging. It was an amazing privilege and though I left early, I was transformed by my years at Harvard, the friendships I made and the ideas I worked on. But taking a serious look back, I do have one big regret. I left Harvard with no real awareness of the awful inequities in the world, the appalling disparities of health and wealth, and opportunity, that condemn millions of people to lives of despair. I learned a lot here at Harvard about new ideas and economics and politics. I got great exposure to the advances being made in the sciences. But humanities greatest advances are not in its discoveries, but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity. [Applause.] Whether through democracy, strong public education, quality health care or broad economic opportunity; reducing inequity is the highest human achievement. I left campus knowing little about the millions of young people cheated out of educational opportunities here in this country. And I knew nothing about the millions of people living in unspeakable poverty and disease in developing countries. It took me decades to find out. You graduates came to Harvard at a different time. You know more about the worlds inequities than the classes that came before. In your years here I've hope you've had a chance to think about how in this age of accelerating technology we can finally take on these inequities and we can solve them. Imagine just for the sake of discussion that you have a few hours a week and a few dollars a month to donate to a cause. And you wanted to spend that time and money where it would have the greatest impact in saving and improving lives. Where would you spend it? For Melinda and I the challenge is the same. How can we do the most good for the greatest number with the resources we have? During our discussions on this question, Melinda and I read an article about the millions of children who are dying every year in poor countries from diseases that we have long ago made harmless in this country. Measles, malaria, pneumonia, hepatitis-b, yellow fever. One disease that I had never heard of, rotavirus, was killing half a million children each year. None of them in the United States. We were shocked. We had assumed that if millions of children were dying and they could be saved, the world would make it a priority to discover and deliver the medicines to save them. But it did not. For under a dollar there were interventions that could save lives that just weren't being delivered. If you believe that every life has equal value, it's revolting to learn that some lives are seen as worth saving and others are not. We said to ourselves this can't be true, but if it is true it deserves to be the priority of our giving. So we begin ou- began our work in the same way anyone here would begin it. We asked, how could the world let these children die? The answer is simple and harsh The market did not reward saving the lives of these children and governments did not subsidise it. So the children die because their mothers and fathers hadno power in the market and no voice in the system. But you and I have both We can make market for- forces work better for the poor if we can develop a more creative capitalism. If we can stretch the reach of market forces so that more people can make a profit or at least earn a living, serving people who are suffering from the great inequities. We can also press governments around the world to spend tax payer money in ways that better reflect the values of the people who pay the taxes. If we can find approaches that meet the needs of the poor in ways that generate profits for business and votes for politicians, we will have found a sustainable way to reduce inequity in the world. Now this task is open ended. It can never be finished, but a conscious effort to answer this challenge can change the world. I'm optimistic that we can do this. But I talk to skeptics who claim there is no hope. They say inequity has been with us since the beginning and will be with us until the end, because people just don't care. I completely disagree. I believe we have more caring than we know what to do with. All of us here in this yard, at one time or another, have seen human tragedies that broke our heart. And yet we did nothing. Not because we don't care, but because we didn't know what to do. If we had known how to help we would have acted. The barrier to change is not too little caring. It is too much complexity. To turn caring into action, we need to see a problem, see a solution and see the impact. But complexity blocks all three steps. Even with the advent of the internet and 24 hour news, it is still a complex enterprise to get people to truly see the problems. When an airplane crashes, officials immediately call a press conference. They promise to investigate, determine the cause and prevent similar crashes in the futures. But if the officials were brutally honest, they would say, \"Of all the people in the world who died today from preventable causes, 1 half of 1 percent were on this plane.\". We're determined to do everything possible to solve the problem that took the lives of 1 half of 1 percent. The problem is not just the plane crash but the millions of preventable deaths. We don't read much about these deaths, the media covers what's new and millions of people dying is nothing new. So it stays in the background where it's easy to ignore. But even when we do see it or read about it, it's difficult to keep our eye- eyes on the problem. It's difficult to look at suffering if the situation is so complex that we don't know how to help and so we look away. If we can really see a problem, which is the first step, we come to the second step. Cutting through the complexity to find a solution. Finding solutions is essential if we want to make the most of our caring. If we have clear and proven answers any time an organisation or an individual asks, \"How can I help?\", then we can get action. And we can make sure that none of the caring in the world is wasted. The complexity makes it hard to mark a path of action for everyone who cares and makes it hard for that caring to matter. Cutting through complexity to find solutions runs through 4 predictable stages: Determine a goal. Find the highest impact approach. Deliver the technology ideal for that approach and in the mean time use the best application of technology you already have. Whether it's something sophisticated like a new drug or something simple like a bed net. The aids epidemic offers an example, the broad goal of course is to end the disease. The highest leverage approach is prevention, the ideal technology would be a vaccine that gives life long immunity with a single dose. So governments, drug companies and foundations are funding vaccine research. But their work is likely to take more than a decade. So in the mean time we have to work with what we have in hand and the best prevention approach we have now is getting people to avoid risky behavior. Pursuing that goal starts the 4 step cycle again. This is the pattern. The crucial thing is to never stop thinking and working. And never do what we did with malaria and tuberculosis in the 20th century. Which is to surrender to complexity and quit. The final step after seeing the problem and finding an approach, is to measure the impact of the work and to share that, success or failure, so that others can learn from the efforts. You have to have the statistics, of course, you have to be able to show for example that a program is vaccinating million more- millions more children. You have to be able to show for example a decline in the number of children dying from the diseases. This is essential not just to improve the program but also to help draw more investment from business and government But if you want to inspire people to participate, you have to show more than numbers. You have to convey the human impact of the work. So people can feel what saving a life means to the families affected. I remember going to the World Economic Forum some years back and sitting on a global health panel that was discussing ways to save millions of lives. Millions. Think of the thrill if you could save just one persons life, then multiply that by millions. Yet this was the most boring panel I had ever been on- [Laughter.] -ever. So boring that even I couldn't stand it. What made that experience especially striking was that I had just come from an event where we were introducing version 13 of some piece of software, and we had people jumping and shouting with excitement. I love getting people excited about software, [Non-emergency siren in distant background.] But why can't we generate even more excitement for saving lives. You can't get people excited unless you can help them see and feel the impact. [Applause.] The way to do that is another complex question. Still, I'm optimistic. Yes inequity has been with us forever, but the new tools we have to cut through complexity have not been with us forever. They are new. They can help us make the most of our caring. And that's why the future can be different from the past. The defining and ongoing innovations of this age, biotechnology, the personal computer and the internet. Give us a chance we've never had before. To end extreme poverty and end death from preventable disease. 60 years ago George Marshall came to this commencement and he announced a plan to assist the nations of post war Europe. He said, I quote \"I think one difficulty, is that the problem is one of such enormous complexity that the very massive facts presented to the public by press and radio, make it exceedingly difficult for the man in the street to reach a clear appraisement of the situation. It is virtually impossible, at this distance, to grasp at all the real significance of the situation.\". 30 years after Marshall made his address, which was 30 years ago, as my class graduated without me. Technology was emerging that would make the world smaller, more open, more visible, less distant. The emergence of low cost personal computers gave rise to a powerful network that has transformed opportunities for learning and communicating. The magical thing about this network is not just that it collapses distance and makes everyone your neighbour. It also dramatically increases the number of brilliant minds we can bring in to work together on the same problem. And it scales up the rate of potential innovation to a staggering degree. At the same time for every person who has access to this technology, 5 people don't. That means many creative minds are left out of this discussion. Smart people with practical intelligence and relevant experience, who don't have the technology to hone their talents or contribute their ideas to the world. We need as many people as possible to gain access to this technology, because these advances are triggering a revolution in human- in what human beings can do for one another. They are making it possible, not just for national governments, but for universities, corporations, small organisations and even individuals to see problems, see approaches and measure the impact of their efforts to address the hunger, poverty and desperation George Marshall spoke of 60 years ago. Members of the Harvard family, here in the yard is one of the great collections of intellectual talent in the world. For what purpose? There is no question that the faculty, the alumni, the students and the benefactors of Harvard have used their power to improve the lives of people here and around the world. But can we do more? Can Harvard dedicate its intellect to improving the lives of people who will never even hear its name. Let me make a request of the deans and professors, the intellectual leaders here at Harvard. As you hire new faculty, award tenure, review curriculum and determine degree requirements, please ask yourself, should our best minds be more dedicated to solving our biggest problems? Should Harvard encourage its faculty to take on the worlds worst inequities? [Applause.] Should Harvard students know about the depth of global poverty, the prevalence of world hunger, the scarcity of clean water, the girls kept out of school, the children who die from diseases we can cure? Should the worlds most privileged learn about the lives of the worlds least privileged? These are not rhetorical questions. [Applause.] You will answer with your policies My mother who was filled with pride the day I was admitted here, never stopped pressing me to do more for others. A few days before I was married she hosted a bridal event at which she read aloud a letter about marriage that she had written to Melinda. My mother was very ill with cancer at the time but she saw one more opportunity to deliver her message and at the close of the letter she said, \"From those to whom much is given, much is expected.\". [Applause.] When you consider what those of us here in this yard have been given in talent, privilege and opportunity, there is almost no limit to what the world has a right to expect from us. In line with the promise of this age, I want to exhort each of the graduates here to take on an issue, a complex problem, a deep inequity and become a specialist on it. If you make it the focus of your career that would be phenomenal. But you don't have to do that to make an impact. For a few hours every week you can use the growing power of the internet to get informed, find others with the same interests, see the barriers and find ways to cut through them. Don't let complexity stop you. Be active- activists. Take on big inequities. Be active- activists. Take on big inequities. I feel sure it will be one of the great experiences of your lives. You graduates are coming of age at an amazing time as you leave Harvard you have technology that members of my class never had. You have awareness of global inequity which we did not have. And with that awareness, you likely also have an informed conscience that will torment if you abandon these people whose lives you could change with modest effort. You have more than we had, you must start sooner and carry on longer. And I hope you will come back here to Harvard 30 years from now and reflect what you have done with your talent and your energy. I hope you will judge yourselves not on your professional accomplishments alone but also on how well you have addressed the worlds deepest inequities. On how well you treated people a world away, who have nothing in common with you but their humanity. Good luck. [Standing applause, one guy cheers.] Thank you Doctor Gates for that important message. You are an inspiration to us all and we thank you for being here today. Please stand and join me now as we sing Fair Harvard, the words are included in your programme. [Fair Harvard Hymn with marching band music.] [Drum roll then clapping.] On behalf of the Harvard Alumni Association I give a warm welcome and congratulations to the class of 2007. [Cheering and applause.] I hope you will return often to Cambridge and will remain engaged with our university. Through the many activities offered by the HAA and the Harvard Clubs around the world. In closing let me quickly add, this year Harvard is extending a warm welcome to the Cambridge Region Latin School as they celebrate their graduating senior class. This ceremony will be held right here, beginning at 6:30. Our remarkable operations crew will now be getting this space ready for that ceremony. [Laughter.] So it's been great to have you all here. I hereby declare that the 2007 meeting of the Harvard Alumni Association is adjourned to be reconvened on June 5th 2008. Thank you all for coming. [Gavel knocks against wood.] [Applause and church bell sounds and marching band plays.] (Male commentator:) And lets see, we have just heard some very exciting talks. One by Derick Bach, one by Bill Gates. And another afternoon exercise come to the end. Tell me your impressions. (Female commentator:) Well Bill Gates speech was in keeping with president Clinton's charge to the senior class yesterday. To go out, use the intellect, the intelligence, the education that you have had here at Harvard to make the world a better place. Bill Gates talked about his own journey from chairman of Microsoft to thinking about how to give back to the world. And his journey with his wife to discover that diseases are in fact eradicable in our lifetimes. And he and his wife are on a mission to, work to, eliminate the diseases of malaria, measles, rotavirus which as he says kills millions of people. Tuberculosis. He talked about the complexity of these sorts of problems and urged the graduates not to allow complexity to deter them. He likened his mission to the Mar- mission of the Marshall plan which George Marshall announced here at the Harvard commencement in 1947. And he urged the graduates to make the world a better place, even if it was only in their spare time. (Male commentator again:) And with that, ringing message, we bring to a close this annual afternoon exercises at Harvard Yard at the tercentenary theater. glad to have had you here and hope you have enjoyed it as much as all the people in this wonderful theater did. Thank you and until next year, farewell. \n",

      " [Applause] I'd like to thank you for leaving crazy person out of the description so I thought I try to think what is the most useful thing that I could but what could I say like that could actually helpful or useful to you in the future and I thought perhaps to tell the story of how I sort of came to be here how did some of these things happen and and maybe there's some lessons there because I often find myself wondering how did this happen so when I was young I I didn't really know what I was going to do we're not when I got older people kept asking me and and but then eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be would be really cool and the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Odyssey clock which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic and and that's really true if you think if you go back say 300 years the things that we take for granted today would be you'd be burned at the stake for you know being able to fly that's crazy being able to see over long distances being able to communicate having effectively with the internet a a group mind of sorts and having access to all the world's information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth this is the stuff that that really would be magic that would be considered magic in times past in fact I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times past they weren't even in the realm of magic so it actually goes goes beyond that so I thought well you know if if I can do some of those things basically if I can advanced technology then that that's like magic and I would be really cool and the the I was at sort of a slight existential crisis because I was trying to figure out what does it all mean like what's the purpose of things and I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the the knowledge of the world if we can do things that expand the scope and and scale of consciousness then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened and and that's really the only way forward so so it's like I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how how the economy works and you also need to built bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as as an individual if it's if it's a significant technology so I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries and that was in 95 and that's also when the internet started to happen and and I thought well I can either pursue this tech this technology where success maybe may not be one of the possible outcomes which is always tricky or participate in the Internet and and be part of it so I decided to drop out now as you unfortunately we're past graduation so I can't be accused of recommending that to you and so it's a did some internet stuff you know put a few things here and there what one of which was PayPal and I think maybe it's helpful to say one of the things that was important than in the creation of PayPal was whispers kind of how it started because initially the initial thought was with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services so if you have one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and and work smoothly and then we had like a little feature which was to do email payments and whenever we'd show that show the system off to someone would show the hard part which was the the agglomeration of financial services which was quite difficult to put together nobody was interested then we'd show people email payments which was actually quite easy and everybody was interested so that this is I think it's important to take feedback from your environment you know it's it you want to be as closed-loop as possible and so we focused on email payments and really try to make that work and and that's what really got things to take off but if we hadn't if we hadn't responded to what people said then we probably would not have been successful so it's important to look for things like that and and focus on them when when you when you see them and you're correct your your prior assumptions and then the going from PayPal I thought well what are some of the the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity it really wasn't from the perspective of what what's the rank or did best way to to make money which which is which is okay but it was really what I think is going to most affect the future humanity so the I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner if we don't solve that this century is the century where we're in deep trouble and then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make life multiplanetary so that's that that's that's the basis for that the latter is the basis force for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and SolarCity and and when I started SpaceX I initially I thought that well is there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company I wasn't that crazy but but then I thought well what is a way to increase NASA's budget that was actually my initial goal so I thought well if we do a low-cost mission to Mars and the COPE Amazo aces which would land seeds with with dehydrate would receive some dehydrated nutrient gel and you hydrate them upon landing and then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background and the the public tends to respond to presidents and superlatives and this would be the first life on Mars the farthest that life's ever traveled as far as we know and and I thought well that that would get people really excited and and and therefore increase with NASA's budget so so obviously the financial outcome from such a mission would probably be zero so anything better than that was on the upside and so I actually went to I went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM because that was the best deal and I can tell you it was very weird going there in 2000 late 2001 2002 going to the Russian rocket forces and saying I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets but you can keep the nuke that's a lot more and this that was 10 years ago I guess so they they I think they they thought I was crazy but but I did have money so that was that was okay and after making several trips to to Russia I came to conclusion that that actually my initial impression was was wrong about because my initial thought was well that that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond Earth and have a Mars base and that kind of thing but I can't Christian that that that was wrong in fact there's plenty of will particularly in the United States because the United States is a nation of explorers the people who came here from from other parts of the world I think the United States really a just a distillation of the spirit of human exploration so but but if people think it's impossible then or it's going to completely break the federal budget then they're not going to do it so after my third trip I said okay well what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and and started SpaceX and this list was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to what one friend made me sit down and watch a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up let me tell you he wasn't far wrong I think there was it was tough going there in the beginning because I'd never built anything physical I mean I'd both like little model rockets as a kid and that kind of thing but I never had a company that built in any physical said have to figure out how to how to do all these things and and bring together the right team of people and and and so we we did all that and and then failed three times it was tough tough going because thinking about a rocket is that the passing grade is a hundred percent and you don't get to actually test the rocket in the real environment that is going to be in so I think to the best analogy for for rocket engineering is it's like if you want to create a really pump complicated but a software you can't run the software as an integrated whole and you can't run it on the computer it's intended to run on but the first time you put it all together and write it on that computer it must run with no bugs that's that's basically the essence of it so we missed the mark there that the first launch I was picking up butts of rocket near the new launch scientist but sad and but we learned with with each success of flight and and were able to with eventually with the fourth flight in 2008 reach orbit and that was also with the last bit of money that we had so they thank goodness that that happened it I think this thing's both times to charm so that's we got the Falcon went orbit and then began to scale that up to to the Falcon 9 which is about an order of magnitude more thrust it's a around a million pounds of thrust and we managed to get that to orbit and then developed Dragon spacecraft which recently was able to dock and return to Earth from the space station that was thanks I was a white knuckled event so yeah it's a huge relief still can't quite believe it actually happened but but there's a lot more that must happen beyond this in order for humanity to become a spacefaring civilization and ultimately a multi-planet species and that's something I think it's it's it's vitally important and and I hope that that some of you will participate in that either at SpaceX or at other companies because it's just really one of the most important things for the preservation and extension of consciousness and it's worth noting as I'm sure people are aware that the earth has been around for four billion years and civilization at least in terms of having writing has been around for ten thousand years and that's being generous so it's it's really it's sort of a tenuous existence that that civilization and and consciousness as we know it is there's been on earth and I think I'm actually I'm actually fairly optimistic about the future of Earth so I don't want to I'd want to sort of people to have the wrong impression that I think we're all about to die I think I think well I think things will most likely be okay for a look for a long time on earth but not not for sure but most likely but even if it's if it's sort of 99% likely one a 1% chance it's still it's still worth spending a fair bit of effort to ensure that we have we've backed up the biosphere in a planetary redundancy if you will and and so I think I think it's really really quite important and in order to that there's a breakthrough that needs to occur which is to create a rapidly and completely reusable transport system to Mars which which is one of those things that's right on the borderline of of impossible but that that's sort of the thing that we're we're going to try to achieve there with with with SpaceX and then on the on the on the Tesla front the goal with Tesla was really to try to show that what what electric cars can do because people had the wrong impression we had to change people's perception of an electric vehicle because they used to think of it as something that was slow and ugly and had low range can like a golf cart and whoop so that's why we created the Tesla Roadster to show that you can be fast attractive and and long range and it's amazing how even though you can show that something works on paper you know and the calculations are very clear until you actually have the physical object and they can they can drive it it doesn't really sink in for people and so that that I think is is something worth noting if you're going to create a company the first thing you should try to do is create a working prototype your everything everything looks great on PowerPoint you can make anything work on PowerPoint but if you have an actual demonstration article even if it's in primitive form that's much much more effective for convincing people so so we made the Tesla Roadster and now we're coming out soon with the Model S which is a four-door sedan because after we made the Tesla Roadster people said oh sure sure we always knew you could make a car like that it's an expensive car and it's low volume and it's small and all that but you can make a real car like okay fine you're gonna make that two so that that's coming out soon and yeah so that that's that that's that's the I think the the word where things are and and and hopefully that there are some lessons to be to be drawn there but I I think the overarching point I want to make is that you guys are the magicians of the 21st century you know don't like anything hold you back imagination is the limit and go out there and create some magic thank you [Applause] I'd like to thank you for leaving crazy person out of the description so I thought I try to think what is the most useful thing that I could what could I say like that could actually helpful or useful to you in the future and I thought perhaps tell the story of how I sort of came to be here how did some of these

      " This program is brought to you by Stanford University. Please visit us at stanford.edu Thank You. I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. Truth be told I never graduated from college and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories. The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: \"We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?\" They said: \"Of course.\" My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life. And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting. It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5 cent deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example: Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating. None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later. Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Beleiveing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart Even when it leads you off the well worn path, and that will make all the difference. My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation the Macintosh a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating. I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over. I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together. I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don't settle. My third story is about death. When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: \"If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right.\" It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: \"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?\" And whenever the answer has been \"No\" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes. I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now. This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true. Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools, and great notions. Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: \"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.\" It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. Thank you all very much.\n",

      " MIT thank you congratulations class of seventeen I especially want to thank chairman Maillard president rive distinguished faculty trustees and members of the class of 1967 it's a privilege to be with you today with your families and your friends on such an amazing important day MIT and Apple share so much we both love hard problems we love the search for new ideas and we especially love finding those ideas the really big ones the ones that can change the world I know MIT has a proud tradition of pranks or as you would call them hacks and you've had pulled off some pretty great ones over the years I'll never figure out how MIT students since that Mars rover to the Krusty Oval or put a propeller beanie on the Great Dome or how you've obviously taken over the president's Twitter account I can tell college students are behind it because most of the tweets happen at 3 a.m. I'm really happy to be here today is about celebration and you have so much to be proud of as you leave here to start the next leg of your journey in life there will be days where you will ask yourself where is all this going what is the purpose what is my purpose I'll be honest I asked myself that same question and it took me nearly 15 years to answer it maybe by talking about my journey today I can save you some time the struggle for me started early on in high school I thought I'd discover my life's purpose when I could answer that age-old question what do you want to be when you grow up nope in college I thought I would discover it when I could answer what's your major not quiet I thought that maybe I discover it when I found a good job then I thought I just needed to get a few promotions that didn't work either I kept convincing myself that it was just over the horizon around the next corner nothing worked and it was really tearing me apart part of me kept pushing ahead to the next achievement and the other part kept asking is this all there is I went to grad school at Duke looking for the answer I tried meditation I sought guidance and religion I read great philosophers and authors and in a moment of youthful and discretion I might even have experimented with a Windows PC and obviously that didn't work after countless twists and turns at last 20 years ago my search brought me to Apple at the time the company was struggling to survive Steve Jobs had just returned to Apple and had launched the think different campaign he wanted to empower the crazy ones The Misfits the rebels the troublemakers the round pegs in the square holes to do their best work if we could just do that Steve knew we could really change the world before that moment I had never met a leader with such passion or encountered a company with such a clear and compelling purpose to serve humanity it was just that simple serve humanity and it was in that moment after 15 years of surging something clicked I finally felt aligned aligned with a company that brought together challenging cutting-edge work with a higher purpose aligned with a leader who believed that technology which didn't exist yet could reinvent tomorrow's world aligned with myself and my own deep need to serve something greater of course at that moment I didn't know all of that I was just grateful to have that psychological burden lifted but with the help of hindsight my breakthrough makes a lot more sense I was never going to find my purpose working someplace without a clear sense of purpose of its own Steven Apple freed me to throw my whole self into my work to embrace their mission and make it my own how can I serve humanity this is life's biggest and most important question when you work towards something greater than yourself you find meaning you find purpose so the question I hope you will carry forward from here is how will you serve humanity the good news is since you're here today you're already on a great track at MIT you've learned how much power science and technology had to change the world for the better thanks to discoveries made right here billions of people are leading healthier more productive more fulfilling lives and if we are ever going to solve some of the hardest problems still facing the world today everything from cancer to climate change to educational inequality then technology will help us do it but technology alone isn't the solution and sometimes it's even part of the problem last year I had the chance to meet with Pope Francis it was the most incredible meeting of my life this is a man who has spent more time comforting the afflicted in slums than he has with heads of state this may surprise you but he knew an unbelievable amount about technology it was obvious to me that he had thought deeply about it its opportunities its risks its morality what he said to me at that meeting what he preached really was on a topic we care a lot about it but he expressed a shared concern in a powerful new way never has humanity had such power over itself yet nothing ensures that it will be used wisely he has said technology today is integral to almost all aspects of our lives and most of the time it's a force for good and yet the potential adverse consequences are spreading faster and cutting deeper than ever before threats to our security threats to our privacy fake news and social media that becomes anti-social sometimes the very technology that is meant to connect us divides us technology is capable of doing great things but it doesn't want to do great things it doesn't want anything that part takes all of us it takes our values in our commitment to our families and our neighbors and our communities our love of beauty and belief that all of our fates are interconnected our decency our kindness I'm not worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans I'm more concerned about people thinking like computers without values or compassion without concern for consequences that is what we need you to help us guard against because of silence because if science is a search in the darkness then the humanities are a candle shows us where we've been and the danger that lies ahead as Steve once said technology alone is not enough it is technology married with the liberal arts married with the humanities that make our hearts a when you keep people at the center of what you do it can have an enormous impact it means an iPhone that allows a blind person to run a marathon it means an Apple watch that catches a heart condition before it becomes a heart attack it means an iPad that helps a child with autism connect with his or her world in short it means technology infused with your values making progress possible for everyone whatever you do in your life and whatever we do at Apple we must infuse it with the humanity that each of us is born with that responsibility is immense but so is the opportunity I'm optimistic because I believe in your generation your passion your journey to serve humanity we are all counting on you there is so much out there conspiring to make you cynical the Internet has enabled so much and empowered so many but it can also be a place where basic rules of decency are suspended and pettiness and negativity thrive don't let that noise knock you off course don't get caught up in the trivial aspects of life don't listen to trolls for God's sake don't become one measure your impact on humanity not in likes but in the lives you touch not in popularity but in the people you serve I found that my life got bigger when I stopped caring what other people thought about me you will find yours will to stay focused on what really matters there will be times when you resolve to serve humanity will be tested be prepared people will try to convince you that you should keep your empathy out of your career don't accept this false premise at a shareholders meeting a few years of back someone questioned apples investment and focus on the environment he asked me to pledge that Apple would only invest in green initiatives that could be justified with the return on investment I tried to be diplomatic I pointed out that Apple does many things like accessibility features for those with disabilities that don't rely on an ROI we do these things because they're the right thing to do and protecting the environment is a critical example he wouldn't let it go and I got my blood up so I told him if you can't accept our position you shouldn't own Apple stock when your condensed that your cause is right have the courage to take a stand if you see a problem or an injustice recognize that no one will fix it but you as you go forward today use your minds and hands and your hearts to build something bigger than yourselves always remember there is no idea bigger than this as dr. Martin Luther King said all life is interrelated we are all bound together into a single garment of destiny if you keep that idea at the forefront of all that you do if you choose to live your lives at that intersection between technology and the people it serves if you strive to create the best give the best do the best for everyone not just for some then today all of humanity has good cause for hope thank you very much and congratulations class of 2017 [Applause]\n"

       "{'Mark_Zuck': ' President Faust, Board of Overseers, faculty, alumni, friends, proud parents, members of the ad board, and graduates of the greatest university in the world, I\\'m honored to be with you today because, let\\'s face it, you accomplished something I never could. If I get through this speech, it\\'ll be the first time I actually finish something at Harvard. Class of 2017, congratulations! I\\'m an unlikely speaker, not just because I dropped out, but because we\\'re technically in the same generation. We walked this yard less than a decade apart, studied the same ideas and slept through the same Ec10 lectures. We may have taken different paths to get here, especially if you came all the way from the Quad, but today I want to share what I\\'ve learned about our generation and the world we\\'re building together. But first, the last couple of days have brought back a lot of good memories. How many of you remember exactly what you were doing when you got that email telling you that you got into Harvard? I was playing Civilization and I ran downstairs, got my dad, and for some reason, his reaction was to video me opening the email. That could have been a really sad video. I swear getting into Harvard is still the thing my parents are most proud of me for. What about your first lecture at Harvard? Mine was Computer Science 121 with the incredible Harry Lewis. I was late so I threw on a t-shirt and didn\\'t realize until afterwards it was inside out and backwards with my tag sticking out the front. I couldn\\'t figure out why no one would talk to me -- except one guy, KX Jin, he just went with it. We ended up doing our problem sets together, and now he runs a big part of Facebook. And that, Class of 2017, is why you should be nice to people. But my best memory from Harvard was meeting Priscilla. I had just launched this prank website Facemash, and the ad board wanted to \"see me\". Everyone thought I was going to get kicked out. My parents came to help me pack. My friends threw me a going away party. As luck would have it, Priscilla was at that party with her friend. We met in line for the bathroom in the Pfoho Belltower, and in what must be one of the all time romantic lines, I said: \"I\\'m going to get kicked out in three days, so we need to go on a date quickly.\" Actually, any of you graduating can use that line. I didn\\'t end up getting kicked out -- I did that to myself. Priscilla and I started dating. And, you know, that movie made it seem like Facemash was so important to creating Facebook. It wasn\\'t. But without Facemash I wouldn\\'t have met Priscilla, and she\\'s the most important person in my life, so you could say it was the most important thing I built in my time here. We\\'ve all started lifelong friendships here, and some of us even families. That\\'s why I\\'m so grateful to this place. Thanks, Harvard. Today I want to talk about purpose. But I\\'m not here to give you the standard commencement about finding your purpose. We\\'re millennials. We\\'ll try to do that instinctively. Instead, I\\'m here to tell you finding your purpose isn\\'t enough. The challenge for our generation is creating a world where everyone has a sense of purpose. One of my favorite stories is when John F Kennedy visited the NASA space center, he saw a janitor carrying a broom and he walked over and asked what he was doing. The janitor responded: \"Mr. President, I\\'m helping put a man on the moon\". Purpose is that sense that we are part of something bigger than ourselves, that we are needed, that we have something better ahead to work for. Purpose is what creates true happiness. You\\'re graduating at a time when this is especially important. When our parents graduated, purpose reliably came from your job, your church, your community. But today, technology and automation are eliminating many jobs. Membership in communities is declining. Many people feel disconnected and depressed, and are trying to fill a void. As I\\'ve traveled around, I\\'ve sat with children in juvenile detention and opioid addicts, who told me their lives could have turned out differently if they just had something to do, an after school program or somewhere to go. I\\'ve met factory workers who know their old jobs aren\\'t coming back and are trying to find their place. To keep our society moving forward, we have a generational challenge -- to not only create new jobs, but create a renewed sense of purpose. I remember the night I launched Facebook from my little dorm in Kirkland House. I went to Noch\\'s with my friend KX. I remember telling him I was excited to connect the Harvard community, but one day someone would connect the whole world. The thing is, it never even occurred to me that someone might be us. We were just college kids. We didn\\'t know anything about that. There were all these big technology companies with resources. I just assumed one of them would do it. But this idea was so clear to us -- that all people want to connect. So we just kept moving forward, day by day. I know a lot of you will have your own stories just like this. A change in the world that seems so clear you\\'re sure someone else will do it. But they won\\'t. You will. But it\\'s not enough to have purpose yourself. You have to create a sense of purpose for others. I found that out the hard way. You see, my hope was never to build a company, but to make an impact. And as all these people started joining us, I just assumed that\\'s what they cared about too, so I never explained what I hoped we\\'d build. A couple years in, some big companies wanted to buy us. I didn\\'t want to sell. I wanted to see if we could connect more people. We were building the first News Feed, and I thought if we could just launch this, it could change how we learn about the world. Nearly everyone else wanted to sell. Without a sense of higher purpose, this was the startup dream come true. It tore our company apart. After one tense argument, an advisor told me if I didn\\'t agree to sell, I would regret the decision for the rest of my life. Relationships were so frayed that within a year or so every single person on the management team was gone. That was my hardest time leading Facebook. I believed in what we were doing, but I felt alone. And worse, it was my fault. I wondered if I was just wrong, an imposter, a 22 year-old kid who had no idea how the world worked. Now, years later, I understand that *is* how things work with no sense of higher purpose. It\\'s up to us to create it so we can all keep moving forward together. Today I want to talk about three ways to create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose: by taking on big meaningful projects together, by redefining equality so everyone has the freedom to pursue purpose, and by building community across the world. First, let\\'s take on big meaningful projects. Our generation will have to deal with tens of millions of jobs replaced by automation like self-driving cars and trucks. But we have the potential to do so much more together. Every generation has its defining works. More than 300,000 people worked to put a man on the moon \\\\\\'96 including that janitor. Millions of volunteers immunized children around the world against polio. Millions of more people built the Hoover dam and other great projects. These projects didn\\'t just provide purpose for the people doing those jobs, they gave our whole country a sense of pride that we could do great things. Now it\\'s our turn to do great things. I know, you\\'re probably thinking: I don\\'t know how to build a dam, or get a million people involved in anything. But let me tell you a secret: no one does when they begin. Ideas don\\'t come out fully formed. They only become clear as you work on them. You just have to get started. If I had to understand everything about connecting people before I began, I never would have started Facebook. Movies and pop culture get this all wrong. The idea of a single eureka moment is a dangerous lie. It makes us feel inadequate since we haven\\'t had ours. It prevents people with seeds of good ideas from getting started. Oh, you know what else movies get wrong about innovation? No one writes math formulas on glass. That\\'s not a thing. It\\'s good to be idealistic. But be prepared to be misunderstood. Anyone working on a big vision will get called crazy, even if you end up right. Anyone working on a complex problem will get blamed for not fully understanding the challenge, even though it\\'s impossible to know everything upfront. Anyone taking initiative will get criticized for moving too fast, because there\\'s always someone who wants to slow you down. In our society, we often don\\'t do big things because we\\'re so afraid of making mistakes that we ignore all the things wrong today if we do nothing. The reality is, anything we do will have issues in the future. But that can\\'t keep us from starting. So what are we waiting for? It\\'s time for our generation-defining public works. How about stopping climate change before we destroy the planet and getting millions of people involved manufacturing and installing solar panels? How about curing all diseases and asking volunteers to track their health data and share their genomes? Today we spend 50x more treating people who are sick than we spend finding cures so people don\\'t get sick in the first place. That makes no sense. We can fix this. How about modernizing democracy so everyone can vote online, and personalizing education so everyone can learn? These achievements are within our reach. Let\\'s do them all in a way that gives everyone in our society a role. Let\\'s do big things, not only to create progress, but to create purpose. So taking on big meaningful projects is the first thing we can do to create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose. The second is redefining equality to give everyone the freedom they need to pursue purpose. Many of our parents had stable jobs throughout their careers. Now we\\'re all entrepreneurial, whether we\\'re starting projects or finding or role. And that\\'s great. Our culture of entrepreneurship is how we create so much progress. Now, an entrepreneurial culture thrives when it\\'s easy to try lots of new ideas. Facebook wasn\\'t the first thing I built. I also built games, chat systems, study tools and music players. I\\'m not alone. JK Rowling got rejected 12 times before publishing Harry Potter. Even Beyonce had to make hundreds of songs to get Halo. The greatest successes come from having the freedom to fail. But today, we have a level of wealth inequality that hurts everyone. When you don\\'t have the freedom to take your idea and turn it into a historic enterprise, we all lose. Right now our society is way over-indexed on rewarding success and we don\\'t do nearly enough to make it easy for everyone to take lots of shots. Let\\'s face it. There is something wrong with our system when I can leave here and make billions of dollars in 10 years while millions of students can\\'t afford to pay off their loans, let alone start a business. Look, I know a lot of entrepreneurs, and I don\\'t know a single person who gave up on starting a business because they might not make enough money. But I know lots of people who haven\\'t pursued dreams because they didn\\'t have a cushion to fall back on if they failed. We all know we don\\'t succeed just by having a good idea or working hard. We succeed by being lucky too. If I had to support my family growing up instead of having time to code, if I didn\\'t know I\\'d be fine if Facebook didn\\'t work out, I wouldn\\'t be standing here today. If we\\'re honest, we all know how much luck we\\'ve had. Every generation expands its definition of equality. Previous generations fought for the vote and civil rights. They had the New Deal and Great Society. Now it\\'s our time to define a new social contract for our generation. We should have a society that measures progress not just by economic metrics like GDP, but by how many of us have a role we find meaningful. We should explore ideas like universal basic income to give everyone a cushion to try new things. We\\\\\\'92re going to change jobs many times, so we need affordable childcare to get to work and healthcare that aren\\'t tied to one company. We\\'re all going to make mistakes, so we need a society that focuses less on locking us up or stigmatizing us. And as technology keeps changing, we need to focus more on continuous education throughout our lives.\\\\ And yes, giving everyone the freedom to pursue purpose isn\\'t free. People like me should pay for it. Many of you will do well and you should too. That\\'s why Priscilla and I started the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and committed our wealth to promoting equal opportunity. These are the values of our generation. It was never a question of if we were going to do this. The only question was when. Millennials are already one of the most charitable generations in history. In one year, three of four US millennials made a donation and seven out of ten raised money for charity. But it\\'s not just about money. You can also give time. I promise you, if you take an hour or two a week -- that\\'s all it takes to give someone a hand, to help them reach their potential. Maybe you think that\\'s too much time. I used to. When Priscilla graduated from Harvard she became a teacher, and before she\\'d do education work with me, she told me I needed to teach a class. I complained: \"Well, I\\'m kind of busy. I\\'m running this company.\" But she insisted, so I taught a middle school program on entrepreneurship at the local Boys and Girls Club. I taught them lessons on product development and marketing, and they taught me what it\\'s like feeling targeted for your race and having a family member in prison. I shared stories from my time in school, and they shared their hope of one day going to college too. For five years now, I\\\\\\'92ve been having dinner with those kids every month. One of them threw me and Priscilla our first baby shower. And next year they\\\\\\'92re going to college. Every one of them. First in their families. We can all make time to give someone a hand. Let\\'s give everyone the freedom to pursue their purpose -- not only because it\\'s the right thing to do, but because when more people can turn their dreams into something great, we\\'re all better for it. Purpose doesn\\'t only come from work. The third way we can create a sense of purpose for everyone is by building community. And when our generation says \"everyone\", we mean everyone in the world. Quick show of hands: how many of you are from another country? Now, how many of you are friends with one of these folks? Now we\\'re talking. We have grown up connected.\\\\ In a survey asking millennials around the world what defines our identity, the most popular answer wasn\\'t nationality, religion or ethnicity, it was \"citizen of the world\". That\\'s a big deal. Every generation expands the circle of people we consider \"one of us\". For us, it now encompasses the entire world. We understand the great arc of human history bends towards people coming together in ever greater numbers -- from tribes to cities to nations -- to achieve things we couldn\\'t on our own. We get that our greatest opportunities are now global -- we can be the generation that ends poverty, that ends disease. We get that our greatest challenges need global responses too -- no country can fight climate change alone or prevent pandemics. Progress now requires coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community. But we live in an unstable time. There are people left behind by globalization across the world. It\\'s hard to care about people in other places if we don\\'t feel good about our lives here at home. There\\'s pressure to turn inwards. This is the struggle of our time. The forces of freedom, openness and global community against the forces of authoritarianism, isolationism and nationalism. Forces for the flow of knowledge, trade and immigration against those who would slow them down. This is not a battle of nations, it\\'s a battle of ideas. There are people in every country for global connection and good people against it. This isn\\'t going to be decided at the UN either. It\\'s going to happen at the local level, when enough of us feel a sense of purpose and stability in our own lives that we can open up and start caring about everyone. The best way to do that is to start building local communities right now. We all get meaning from our communities. Whether our communities are houses or sports teams, churches or music groups, they give us that sense we are part of something bigger, that we are not alone; they give us the strength to expand our horizons. That\\'s why it\\'s so striking that for decades, membership in all kinds of groups has declined as much as one-quarter. That\\'s a lot of people who now need to find purpose somewhere else. But I know we can rebuild our communities and start new ones because many of you already are. I met Agnes Igoye, who\\'s graduating today. Where are you, Agnes? She spent her childhood navigating conflict zones in Uganda, and now she trains thousands of law enforcement officers to keep communities safe. I met Kayla Oakley and Niha Jain, graduating today, too. Stand up. Kayla and Niha started a non-profit that connects people suffering from illnesses with people in their communities willing to help. I met David Razu Aznar, graduating from the Kennedy School today. David, stand up. He\\'s a former city councilor who successfully led the battle to make Mexico City the first Latin American city to pass marriage equality -- even before San Francisco. This is my story too. A student in a dorm room, connecting one community at a time, and keeping at it until one day we connect the whole world. Change starts local. Even global changes start small -- with people like us. In our generation, the struggle of whether we connect more, whether we achieve our biggest opportunities, comes down to this -- your ability to build communities and create a world where every single person has a sense of purpose. Class of 2017, you are graduating into a world that needs purpose. It\\'s up to you to create it. Now, you may be thinking: can I really do this? Remember when I told you about that class I taught at the Boys and Girls Club? One day after class I was talking to them about college, and one of my top students raised his hand and said he wasn\\'t sure he could go because he\\'s undocumented. He didn\\'t know if they\\'d let him in. Last year I took him out to breakfast for his birthday. I wanted to get him a present, so I asked him and he started talking about students he saw struggling and said \"You know, I\\'d really just like a book on social justice.\" I was blown away. Here\\'s a young guy who has every reason to be cynical. He didn\\'t know if the country he calls home -- the only one he\\'s known -- would deny him his dream of going to college. But he wasn\\'t feeling sorry for himself. He wasn\\'t even thinking of himself. He has a greater sense of purpose, and he\\'s going to bring people along with him. It says something about our current situation that I can\\'t even say his name because I don\\'t want to put him at risk. But if a high school senior who doesn\\'t know what the future holds can do his part to move the world forward, then we owe it to the world to do our part too. Before you walk out those gates one last time, as we sit in front of Memorial Church, I am reminded of a prayer, Mi Shebeirach, that I say whenever I face a challenge, that I sing to my daughter thinking about her future when I tuck her into bed. It goes: \"May the source of strength, who blessed the ones before us, help us *find the courage* to make our lives a blessing.\" I hope you find the courage to make your life a blessing. Congratulations, Class of \\'17! Good luck out there. ',\n",
       " 'Larry_Page': ' Class of 2009! I don\\'t think I heard you. Class of 2009! First I\\'d like you to stand up, wave and cheer your supportive family and friends! I\\'m sure you can find them out there. Show your love! It is a great honor for me to be here today. Now wait a second. I know: that\\'s such a cliche? You\\'re thinking: every graduation speaker says that -- It\\'s a great honor. But, in my case, it really is so deeply true -- being here is more special and more personal for me than most of you know. I\\'d like to tell you why. A long time ago, in this cold September of 1962, there was a Steven\\'s co-op at this very university. That co-op had a kitchen with a ceiling that had been cleaned by student volunteers probably every decade or so. Picture a college girl named Gloria, climbing up high on a ladder, struggling to clean that filthy ceiling. Standing on the floor, a young boarder named Carl was admiring the view. And that\\'s how they met. They were my parents, so I suppose you could say I\\'m a direct result of that kitchen chemistry experiment, right here at Michigan. My Mom is here with us today, and we should probably go find the spot and put a plaque up on the ceiling that says: \"Thanks Mom and Dad!\" Everyone in my family went here at Michigan: me, my brother, my Mom and Dad -- all of us. My Dad actually got the quantity discount: all three and a half of his degrees are from here. His Ph.D. was in Communication Science because they thought Computers were just a passing fad. When he earned it 44 years ago. He and Mom made a big sacrifice for that. They argued at times over pennies, while raising my newborn brother. Mom typed my Dad\\'s dissertation by hand. Kind of ironic given it was a computer science dissertation. This velvet hood I\\'m wearing, this was my Dad\\'s. This diploma, just like the one you\\'re about to get, this was my Dad\\'s. And my underwear... oh never mind. Sorry. My father\\'s father worked in the Chevy plant in Flint, Michigan. He was an assembly line worker. He drove his two children here to Ann Arbor, and told them: That is where you\\'re going to go to college. I know it sounds funny now. Both of his kids did graduate from Michigan. That was the American dream. His daughter, Beverly, is with us today. My Grandpa used to carry an \"Alley Oop\" hammer -- a heavy iron pipe with a hunk of lead melted on the end. The workers made them during the sit-down strikes to protect themselves. When I was growing up, we used that hammer whenever we needed to pound a stake or something into the ground. It is wonderful that most people don\\'t need to carry a heavy blunt object for protection anymore. But just in case, I brought it with me. Al right... My Dad became a professor at... Michigan State, and I was an incredibly lucky boy. A professor\\'s life is pretty flexible, and he was able to spend oodles of time raising me. Could there be a better upbringing than university brat? What I\\'m trying to tell you is that this is WAY more than just a homecoming for me. It\\'s not easy for me to express how proud I am to be here, with my Mom, my brother and my wife Lucy, and with all of you, at this amazing institution that is responsible for my very existence. I am thrilled for all of you, and I\\'m thrilled for your families and friends, as all of us join the great, big Michigan family I feel I\\'ve been a part of all of my life. What I\\'m also trying to tell you is that I know exactly what it feels like to be sitting in your seat, listening to some old gasbag give a long-winded commencement speech. Don\\'t worry. I\\'ll be brief. I have a story about following dreams. Or maybe more accurately, it\\'s a story about finding a path to make those dreams real. You know what it\\'s like to wake up in the middle of the night with a vivid dream? And you know how, if you don\\'t have a pencil and pad by the bed, it will be completely gone the next morning? Well, I had one of those dreams when I was 23. When I suddenly woke up, I was thinking: what if we could download the whole web, and just keep the links and... I grabbed a pen and started writing! Sometimes it is important to wake up and stop dreaming. I spent the middle of that night scribbling out the details and convincing myself it would work. Soon after, I told my advisor, Terry Winograd, it would take a couple of weeks to download the web -- he nodded knowingly, fully aware it would take much longer but wise enough to not tell me. The optimism of youth is often underrated! Amazingly, At that time I had no thought of building a search engine. The idea wasn\\'t even on the radar. But, much later we happened upon a better way of ranking and we made a really great search engine, and Google was born. When a really great dream shows up, grab it! When I was here at Michigan, I had actually been taught how to make dreams real! I know it sounds funny, but that is what I learned in a summer camp converted into a training program called Leadershape. Yeh, we got a few out there. Their slogan is to have a \"healthy disregard for the impossible\". That program encouraged me to pursue a crazy idea at the time: I wanted to build a personal rapid transit system on campus to replace the buses. Yeh, you\\'re still working on that, I hear. It was a futuristic way of solving our transportation problem. I still think a lot about transportation -- you never loose a dream, it just incubates as a hobby. Many things that people labor hard to do now, like cooking, cleaning, and driving will require much less human time in the future. That is, if we \"have a healthy disregard for the impossible\" and actually build new solutions. I think it is often easier to make progress on mega-ambitious dreams. I know that sounds completely nuts. But, since no one else is crazy enough to do it, you have little competition. In fact, there are so few people this crazy that I feel like I know them all by first name. They all travel as if they are pack dogs and stick to each other like glue. The best people want to work the big challenges. That is what happened with Google. Our mission is to organize the world\\'s information and make it universally accessible and useful. How can that not get you excited? But we almost didn\\'t start Google because my co-founder Sergey and I were too worried about dropping out of our Ph.D. program. None of you have that issue, it seems. You are probably on the right track if you feel like a sidewalk worm during a rainstorm! That is about how we felt after we maxed out three credit cards buying hard disks off the back of a truck. That was actually the first hardware for Google. Parents and friends: more credit cards always help. What is the one sentence summary of how you change the world? Always work hard on something uncomfortably exciting! As a Ph.D. student, I actually had three projects I wanted to work on. Thank goodness my advisor said, \"why don\\'t you work on the web for a while\". He gave me some seriously good advice because the web was really growing with people and activity, even in 1995! Technology and especially the internet can really help you be lazy. Lazy? What I mean is a group of three people can write software that then millions can use and enjoy. Can three people answer the phone a million times? Find the leverage in the world, so you can be more lazy! Overall, I know it seems like the world is crumbling out there, but it is actually a great time in your life to get a little crazy, follow your curiosity, and be ambitious about it. Don\\'t give up on your dreams. The world needs you all! So here\\'s my final story: On a day like today, you might feel exhilarated — like you\\'ve just been shot out of a cannon at the circus -- and even invincible. Don\\'t ever forget that incredible feeling. But also: always remember that the moments we have with friends and family, the chances we have to do things that might make a big difference in the world, or even to make a small difference to someone you love — all those wonderful chances that life gives us, life also takes away. It can happen fast, and a whole lot sooner than you think. In late March 1996, soon after I had moved to Stanford for grad school, my Dad had difficultly breathing and drove to the hospital. Two months later, he died. I was completely devastated. Many years later, after a startup, after falling in love, and after so many of life\\'s adventures, I found myself thinking about my Dad. Lucy and I were far away in a steaming hot village walking through narrow streets. There were wonderful friendly people everywhere, but it was a desperately poor place -- people used the bathroom inside and it flowed out into the open gutter and straight into the river. We touched a boy with a limp leg, the result of paralysis from polio. Lucy and I were in rural India -- one of the few places where Polio still exists. Polio is transmitted fecal to oral, usually through filthy water. Well, my Dad had Polio. He went on a trip to Tennessee in the first grade and caught it. He was hospitalized for two months and had to be transported by military DC-3 back home -- his first flight. My Dad wrote, \"Then, I had to stay in bed for over a year, before I started back to school\". That is actually a quote from his fifth grade autobiography. My Dad had difficulty breathing his whole life, and the complications of Polio are what took him from us too soon. He would have been very upset that Polio still persists even though we have a vaccine. He would have been equally upset that back in India we had polio virus on our shoes from walking through the contaminated gutters that spread the disease. We were spreading the virus with every footstep, right under beautiful kids playing everywhere. The world is on the verge of eliminating polio, with 328 people infected so far. Let\\'s get it done soon. Perhaps one of you will do that. My Dad was valedictorian of the Flint Mandeville High School class of 1956 of about 90 kids. I happened across his graduating speech recently, and it blew me away. 53 years ago at his graduation my Dad said: \"...we are entering a changing world, one of automation and employment change where education is an economic necessity. We will have increased periods of time to do as we wish, as our work week and retirement age continue to decline... (Or we wish that were true....) We shall take part in, or witness, developments in science, medicine, and industry that we can only dream of today. ... It is said that the future of any nation can be determined by the care and preparation given to its youth. If all the youths of America were as fortunate in securing an education as we have been, then the future of the United States would be even more bright than it is today.\" If my Dad was alive today, the thing I think he would be most happy about is that Lucy and I have a baby in the hopper. Yeh, let\\'s cheer Lucy. I think he would have been annoyed that I hadn\\'t gotten my Ph.D. yet (thanks, Michigan!). Dad was so full of insights, of excitement about new things, to this day, I often wonder what he would think about some new development. If he were here today -- well, it would be one of the best days of his life. He\\'d be like a kid in a candy store. For a day, he\\'d be young again. Many of us are fortunate enough to be here with family. Some of us have dear friends and family to go home to. And who knows, perhaps some of you, like Lucy and I, are dreaming of future families of your own. Just like me, your families brought you here, and you brought them here. Please keep them close and remember: they are what really matters in life. Thanks, Mom; Thanks, Lucy. And thank you, all, very much. ',\n",
       " 'Bill_Gates': ' President Bach, former president Rudenstine, incoming president Faust, members of the Harvard corporation and the board of overseers. Members of the faculty, parents and especially the graduates. I\\'ve been waiting more than 30 years to say this. Dad I always told you I\\'d come back and get my degree. [Applause and some laughter.] I wanna thank Harvard for this honour. I\\'ll be changing my job next year and it will be nice to finally have a college degree on my resume. [Laughter.] I applaud the graduates for taking a much more direct route to your degrees. From our- my part I\\'m just happy that the Crimson called me Harvard\\'s most successful drop out. I guess that makes me valedictorian of my own special class. I did the best of everyone who failed. [Laughter.] But I also want to be recognised as the guy who got Steve Balmer to drop out of business school. [Laughter and then also applause.] I\\'m a bad influence. That\\'s why I was invited to speak at your graduation. If I\\'d spoken at your orientation fewer of you might be here today. [Laughter then also applause.] Harvard was a phenomenal experience for me. Academic life was fascinating. I used to sit in on lots of classes that I hadn\\'t even signed up for. And dorm life was terrific. I lived up at Radcliffe, in Courier House. [Cheering.] There were always a lot of people in my dorm room late at night discussing things, because everyone knew that I didn\\'t worry about getting up in the morning. [Laughter.] That\\'s how I came to be the leader of the antisocial group. We clunged each other as a way of validating our rejection of all those social people. Radcliffe was a great place to live. There were more women up there and most of the guys were math-science types. The combination offered me the best odds, if you know what I mean. [Laughing.] That\\'s where I learned the sad lesson that improving your odds doesn\\'t guarantee you success. [Laughing.] One of my biggest memories of Harvard came in January 1975. When I made a call from Courier House to a company in Albuquerque, New Mexico, that had begun making the worlds first personal computer. I offered to sell them software. I worried they would realise I was just a student in a dorm and hang up on me. Instead they said, we\\'re not quite ready, come see us in a month. Which was a good thing because we hadn\\'t written the software yet. [Laughing.] From that moment I worked day and night on the extra credit project that marked the end of my college education and the beginning of a remarkable journey with Microsoft. What I remember above all about Harvard, was being in the midst of so much energy and intelligence. It could be exhilarating, intimidating, sometimes even discouraging but always challenging. It was an amazing privilege and though I left early, I was transformed by my years at Harvard, the friendships I made and the ideas I worked on. But taking a serious look back, I do have one big regret. I left Harvard with no real awareness of the awful inequities in the world, the appalling disparities of health and wealth, and opportunity, that condemn millions of people to lives of despair. I learned a lot here at Harvard about new ideas and economics and politics. I got great exposure to the advances being made in the sciences. But humanities greatest advances are not in its discoveries, but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity. [Applause.] Whether through democracy, strong public education, quality health care or broad economic opportunity; reducing inequity is the highest human achievement. I left campus knowing little about the millions of young people cheated out of educational opportunities here in this country. And I knew nothing about the millions of people living in unspeakable poverty and disease in developing countries. It took me decades to find out. You graduates came to Harvard at a different time. You know more about the worlds inequities than the classes that came before. In your years here I\\'ve hope you\\'ve had a chance to think about how in this age of accelerating technology we can finally take on these inequities and we can solve them. Imagine just for the sake of discussion that you have a few hours a week and a few dollars a month to donate to a cause. And you wanted to spend that time and money where it would have the greatest impact in saving and improving lives. Where would you spend it? For Melinda and I the challenge is the same. How can we do the most good for the greatest number with the resources we have? During our discussions on this question, Melinda and I read an article about the millions of children who are dying every year in poor countries from diseases that we have long ago made harmless in this country. Measles, malaria, pneumonia, hepatitis-b, yellow fever. One disease that I had never heard of, rotavirus, was killing half a million children each year. None of them in the United States. We were shocked. We had assumed that if millions of children were dying and they could be saved, the world would make it a priority to discover and deliver the medicines to save them. But it did not. For under a dollar there were interventions that could save lives that just weren\\'t being delivered. If you believe that every life has equal value, it\\'s revolting to learn that some lives are seen as worth saving and others are not. We said to ourselves this can\\'t be true, but if it is true it deserves to be the priority of our giving. So we begin ou- began our work in the same way anyone here would begin it. We asked, how could the world let these children die? The answer is simple and harsh The market did not reward saving the lives of these children and governments did not subsidise it. So the children die because their mothers and fathers hadno power in the market and no voice in the system. But you and I have both We can make market for- forces work better for the poor if we can develop a more creative capitalism. If we can stretch the reach of market forces so that more people can make a profit or at least earn a living, serving people who are suffering from the great inequities. We can also press governments around the world to spend tax payer money in ways that better reflect the values of the people who pay the taxes. If we can find approaches that meet the needs of the poor in ways that generate profits for business and votes for politicians, we will have found a sustainable way to reduce inequity in the world. Now this task is open ended. It can never be finished, but a conscious effort to answer this challenge can change the world. I\\'m optimistic that we can do this. But I talk to skeptics who claim there is no hope. They say inequity has been with us since the beginning and will be with us until the end, because people just don\\'t care. I completely disagree. I believe we have more caring than we know what to do with. All of us here in this yard, at one time or another, have seen human tragedies that broke our heart. And yet we did nothing. Not because we don\\'t care, but because we didn\\'t know what to do. If we had known how to help we would have acted. The barrier to change is not too little caring. It is too much complexity. To turn caring into action, we need to see a problem, see a solution and see the impact. But complexity blocks all three steps. Even with the advent of the internet and 24 hour news, it is still a complex enterprise to get people to truly see the problems. When an airplane crashes, officials immediately call a press conference. They promise to investigate, determine the cause and prevent similar crashes in the futures. But if the officials were brutally honest, they would say, \"Of all the people in the world who died today from preventable causes, 1 half of 1 percent were on this plane.\". We\\'re determined to do everything possible to solve the problem that took the lives of 1 half of 1 percent. The problem is not just the plane crash but the millions of preventable deaths. We don\\'t read much about these deaths, the media covers what\\'s new and millions of people dying is nothing new. So it stays in the background where it\\'s easy to ignore. But even when we do see it or read about it, it\\'s difficult to keep our eye- eyes on the problem. It\\'s difficult to look at suffering if the situation is so complex that we don\\'t know how to help and so we look away. If we can really see a problem, which is the first step, we come to the second step. Cutting through the complexity to find a solution. Finding solutions is essential if we want to make the most of our caring. If we have clear and proven answers any time an organisation or an individual asks, \"How can I help?\", then we can get action. And we can make sure that none of the caring in the world is wasted. The complexity makes it hard to mark a path of action for everyone who cares and makes it hard for that caring to matter. Cutting through complexity to find solutions runs through 4 predictable stages: Determine a goal. Find the highest impact approach. Deliver the technology ideal for that approach and in the mean time use the best application of technology you already have. Whether it\\'s something sophisticated like a new drug or something simple like a bed net. The aids epidemic offers an example, the broad goal of course is to end the disease. The highest leverage approach is prevention, the ideal technology would be a vaccine that gives life long immunity with a single dose. So governments, drug companies and foundations are funding vaccine research. But their work is likely to take more than a decade. So in the mean time we have to work with what we have in hand and the best prevention approach we have now is getting people to avoid risky behavior. Pursuing that goal starts the 4 step cycle again. This is the pattern. The crucial thing is to never stop thinking and working. And never do what we did with malaria and tuberculosis in the 20th century. Which is to surrender to complexity and quit. The final step after seeing the problem and finding an approach, is to measure the impact of the work and to share that, success or failure, so that others can learn from the efforts. You have to have the statistics, of course, you have to be able to show for example that a program is vaccinating million more- millions more children. You have to be able to show for example a decline in the number of children dying from the diseases. This is essential not just to improve the program but also to help draw more investment from business and government But if you want to inspire people to participate, you have to show more than numbers. You have to convey the human impact of the work. So people can feel what saving a life means to the families affected. I remember going to the World Economic Forum some years back and sitting on a global health panel that was discussing ways to save millions of lives. Millions. Think of the thrill if you could save just one persons life, then multiply that by millions. Yet this was the most boring panel I had ever been on- [Laughter.] -ever. So boring that even I couldn\\'t stand it. What made that experience especially striking was that I had just come from an event where we were introducing version 13 of some piece of software, and we had people jumping and shouting with excitement. I love getting people excited about software, [Non-emergency siren in distant background.] But why can\\'t we generate even more excitement for saving lives. You can\\'t get people excited unless you can help them see and feel the impact. [Applause.] The way to do that is another complex question. Still, I\\'m optimistic. Yes inequity has been with us forever, but the new tools we have to cut through complexity have not been with us forever. They are new. They can help us make the most of our caring. And that\\'s why the future can be different from the past. The defining and ongoing innovations of this age, biotechnology, the personal computer and the internet. Give us a chance we\\'ve never had before. To end extreme poverty and end death from preventable disease. 60 years ago George Marshall came to this commencement and he announced a plan to assist the nations of post war Europe. He said, I quote \"I think one difficulty, is that the problem is one of such enormous complexity that the very massive facts presented to the public by press and radio, make it exceedingly difficult for the man in the street to reach a clear appraisement of the situation. It is virtually impossible, at this distance, to grasp at all the real significance of the situation.\". 30 years after Marshall made his address, which was 30 years ago, as my class graduated without me. Technology was emerging that would make the world smaller, more open, more visible, less distant. The emergence of low cost personal computers gave rise to a powerful network that has transformed opportunities for learning and communicating. The magical thing about this network is not just that it collapses distance and makes everyone your neighbour. It also dramatically increases the number of brilliant minds we can bring in to work together on the same problem. And it scales up the rate of potential innovation to a staggering degree. At the same time for every person who has access to this technology, 5 people don\\'t. That means many creative minds are left out of this discussion. Smart people with practical intelligence and relevant experience, who don\\'t have the technology to hone their talents or contribute their ideas to the world. We need as many people as possible to gain access to this technology, because these advances are triggering a revolution in human- in what human beings can do for one another. They are making it possible, not just for national governments, but for universities, corporations, small organisations and even individuals to see problems, see approaches and measure the impact of their efforts to address the hunger, poverty and desperation George Marshall spoke of 60 years ago. Members of the Harvard family, here in the yard is one of the great collections of intellectual talent in the world. For what purpose? There is no question that the faculty, the alumni, the students and the benefactors of Harvard have used their power to improve the lives of people here and around the world. But can we do more? Can Harvard dedicate its intellect to improving the lives of people who will never even hear its name. Let me make a request of the deans and professors, the intellectual leaders here at Harvard. As you hire new faculty, award tenure, review curriculum and determine degree requirements, please ask yourself, should our best minds be more dedicated to solving our biggest problems? Should Harvard encourage its faculty to take on the worlds worst inequities? [Applause.] Should Harvard students know about the depth of global poverty, the prevalence of world hunger, the scarcity of clean water, the girls kept out of school, the children who die from diseases we can cure? Should the worlds most privileged learn about the lives of the worlds least privileged? These are not rhetorical questions. [Applause.] You will answer with your policies My mother who was filled with pride the day I was admitted here, never stopped pressing me to do more for others. A few days before I was married she hosted a bridal event at which she read aloud a letter about marriage that she had written to Melinda. My mother was very ill with cancer at the time but she saw one more opportunity to deliver her message and at the close of the letter she said, \"From those to whom much is given, much is expected.\". [Applause.] When you consider what those of us here in this yard have been given in talent, privilege and opportunity, there is almost no limit to what the world has a right to expect from us. In line with the promise of this age, I want to exhort each of the graduates here to take on an issue, a complex problem, a deep inequity and become a specialist on it. If you make it the focus of your career that would be phenomenal. But you don\\'t have to do that to make an impact. For a few hours every week you can use the growing power of the internet to get informed, find others with the same interests, see the barriers and find ways to cut through them. Don\\'t let complexity stop you. Be active- activists. Take on big inequities. Be active- activists. Take on big inequities. I feel sure it will be one of the great experiences of your lives. You graduates are coming of age at an amazing time as you leave Harvard you have technology that members of my class never had. You have awareness of global inequity which we did not have. And with that awareness, you likely also have an informed conscience that will torment if you abandon these people whose lives you could change with modest effort. You have more than we had, you must start sooner and carry on longer. And I hope you will come back here to Harvard 30 years from now and reflect what you have done with your talent and your energy. I hope you will judge yourselves not on your professional accomplishments alone but also on how well you have addressed the worlds deepest inequities. On how well you treated people a world away, who have nothing in common with you but their humanity. Good luck. [Standing applause, one guy cheers.] Thank you Doctor Gates for that important message. You are an inspiration to us all and we thank you for being here today. Please stand and join me now as we sing Fair Harvard, the words are included in your programme. [Fair Harvard Hymn with marching band music.] [Drum roll then clapping.] On behalf of the Harvard Alumni Association I give a warm welcome and congratulations to the class of 2007. [Cheering and applause.] I hope you will return often to Cambridge and will remain engaged with our university. Through the many activities offered by the HAA and the Harvard Clubs around the world. In closing let me quickly add, this year Harvard is extending a warm welcome to the Cambridge Region Latin School as they celebrate their graduating senior class. This ceremony will be held right here, beginning at 6:30. Our remarkable operations crew will now be getting this space ready for that ceremony. [Laughter.] So it\\'s been great to have you all here. I hereby declare that the 2007 meeting of the Harvard Alumni Association is adjourned to be reconvened on June 5th 2008. Thank you all for coming. [Gavel knocks against wood.] [Applause and church bell sounds and marching band plays.] (Male commentator:) And lets see, we have just heard some very exciting talks. One by Derick Bach, one by Bill Gates. And another afternoon exercise come to the end. Tell me your impressions. (Female commentator:) Well Bill Gates speech was in keeping with president Clinton\\'s charge to the senior class yesterday. To go out, use the intellect, the intelligence, the education that you have had here at Harvard to make the world a better place. Bill Gates talked about his own journey from chairman of Microsoft to thinking about how to give back to the world. And his journey with his wife to discover that diseases are in fact eradicable in our lifetimes. And he and his wife are on a mission to, work to, eliminate the diseases of malaria, measles, rotavirus which as he says kills millions of people. Tuberculosis. He talked about the complexity of these sorts of problems and urged the graduates not to allow complexity to deter them. He likened his mission to the Mar- mission of the Marshall plan which George Marshall announced here at the Harvard commencement in 1947. And he urged the graduates to make the world a better place, even if it was only in their spare time. (Male commentator again:) And with that, ringing message, we bring to a close this annual afternoon exercises at Harvard Yard at the tercentenary theater. glad to have had you here and hope you have enjoyed it as much as all the people in this wonderful theater did. Thank you and until next year, farewell. ',\n",
       " 'Elon_Musk': \" [Applause] I'd like to thank you for leaving crazy person out of the description so I thought I try to think what is the most useful thing that I could but what could I say like that could actually helpful or useful to you in the future and I thought perhaps to tell the story of how I sort of came to be here how did some of these things happen and and maybe there's some lessons there because I often find myself wondering how did this happen so when I was young I I didn't really know what I was going to do we're not when I got older people kept asking me and and but then eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be would be really cool and the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Odyssey clock which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic and and that's really true if you think if you go back say 300 years the things that we take for granted today would be you'd be burned at the stake for you know being able to fly that's crazy being able to see over long distances being able to communicate having effectively with the internet a a group mind of sorts and having access to all the world's information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth this is the stuff that that really would be magic that would be considered magic in times past in fact I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times past they weren't even in the realm of magic so it actually goes goes beyond that so I thought well you know if if I can do some of those things basically if I can advanced technology then that that's like magic and I would be really cool and the the I was at sort of a slight existential crisis because I was trying to figure out what does it all mean like what's the purpose of things and I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the the knowledge of the world if we can do things that expand the scope and and scale of consciousness then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened and and that's really the only way forward so so it's like I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how how the economy works and you also need to built bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as as an individual if it's if it's a significant technology so I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries and that was in 95 and that's also when the internet started to happen and and I thought well I can either pursue this tech this technology where success maybe may not be one of the possible outcomes which is always tricky or participate in the Internet and and be part of it so I decided to drop out now as you unfortunately we're past graduation so I can't be accused of recommending that to you and so it's a did some internet stuff you know put a few things here and there what one of which was PayPal and I think maybe it's helpful to say one of the things that was important than in the creation of PayPal was whispers kind of how it started because initially the initial thought was with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services so if you have one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and and work smoothly and then we had like a little feature which was to do email payments and whenever we'd show that show the system off to someone would show the hard part which was the the agglomeration of financial services which was quite difficult to put together nobody was interested then we'd show people email payments which was actually quite easy and everybody was interested so that this is I think it's important to take feedback from your environment you know it's it you want to be as closed-loop as possible and so we focused on email payments and really try to make that work and and that's what really got things to take off but if we hadn't if we hadn't responded to what people said then we probably would not have been successful so it's important to look for things like that and and focus on them when when you when you see them and you're correct your your prior assumptions and then the going from PayPal I thought well what are some of the the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity it really wasn't from the perspective of what what's the rank or did best way to to make money which which is which is okay but it was really what I think is going to most affect the future humanity so the I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner if we don't solve that this century is the century where we're in deep trouble and then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make life multiplanetary so that's that that's that's the basis for that the latter is the basis force for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and SolarCity and and when I started SpaceX I initially I thought that well is there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company I wasn't that crazy but but then I thought well what is a way to increase NASA's budget that was actually my initial goal so I thought well if we do a low-cost mission to Mars and the COPE Amazo aces which would land seeds with with dehydrate would receive some dehydrated nutrient gel and you hydrate them upon landing and then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background and the the public tends to respond to presidents and superlatives and this would be the first life on Mars the farthest that life's ever traveled as far as we know and and I thought well that that would get people really excited and and and therefore increase with NASA's budget so so obviously the financial outcome from such a mission would probably be zero so anything better than that was on the upside and so I actually went to I went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM because that was the best deal and I can tell you it was very weird going there in 2000 late 2001 2002 going to the Russian rocket forces and saying I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets but you can keep the nuke that's a lot more and this that was 10 years ago I guess so they they I think they they thought I was crazy but but I did have money so that was that was okay and after making several trips to to Russia I came to conclusion that that actually my initial impression was was wrong about because my initial thought was well that that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond Earth and have a Mars base and that kind of thing but I can't Christian that that that was wrong in fact there's plenty of will particularly in the United States because the United States is a nation of explorers the people who came here from from other parts of the world I think the United States really a just a distillation of the spirit of human exploration so but but if people think it's impossible then or it's going to completely break the federal budget then they're not going to do it so after my third trip I said okay well what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and and started SpaceX and this list was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to what one friend made me sit down and watch a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up let me tell you he wasn't far wrong I think there was it was tough going there in the beginning because I'd never built anything physical I mean I'd both like little model rockets as a kid and that kind of thing but I never had a company that built in any physical said have to figure out how to how to do all these things and and bring together the right team of people and and and so we we did all that and and then failed three times it was tough tough going because thinking about a rocket is that the passing grade is a hundred percent and you don't get to actually test the rocket in the real environment that is going to be in so I think to the best analogy for for rocket engineering is it's like if you want to create a really pump complicated but a software you can't run the software as an integrated whole and you can't run it on the computer it's intended to run on but the first time you put it all together and write it on that computer it must run with no bugs that's that's basically the essence of it so we missed the mark there that the first launch I was picking up butts of rocket near the new launch scientist but sad and but we learned with with each success of flight and and were able to with eventually with the fourth flight in 2008 reach orbit and that was also with the last bit of money that we had so they thank goodness that that happened it I think this thing's both times to charm so that's we got the Falcon went orbit and then began to scale that up to to the Falcon 9 which is about an order of magnitude more thrust it's a around a million pounds of thrust and we managed to get that to orbit and then developed Dragon spacecraft which recently was able to dock and return to Earth from the space station that was thanks I was a white knuckled event so yeah it's a huge relief still can't quite believe it actually happened but but there's a lot more that must happen beyond this in order for humanity to become a spacefaring civilization and ultimately a multi-planet species and that's something I think it's it's it's vitally important and and I hope that that some of you will participate in that either at SpaceX or at other companies because it's just really one of the most important things for the preservation and extension of consciousness and it's worth noting as I'm sure people are aware that the earth has been around for four billion years and civilization at least in terms of having writing has been around for ten thousand years and that's being generous so it's it's really it's sort of a tenuous existence that that civilization and and consciousness as we know it is there's been on earth and I think I'm actually I'm actually fairly optimistic about the future of Earth so I don't want to I'd want to sort of people to have the wrong impression that I think we're all about to die I think I think well I think things will most likely be okay for a look for a long time on earth but not not for sure but most likely but even if it's if it's sort of 99% likely one a 1% chance it's still it's still worth spending a fair bit of effort to ensure that we have we've backed up the biosphere in a planetary redundancy if you will and and so I think I think it's really really quite important and in order to that there's a breakthrough that needs to occur which is to create a rapidly and completely reusable transport system to Mars which which is one of those things that's right on the borderline of of impossible but that that's sort of the thing that we're we're going to try to achieve there with with with SpaceX and then on the on the on the Tesla front the goal with Tesla was really to try to show that what what electric cars can do because people had the wrong impression we had to change people's perception of an electric vehicle because they used to think of it as something that was slow and ugly and had low range can like a golf cart and whoop so that's why we created the Tesla Roadster to show that you can be fast attractive and and long range and it's amazing how even though you can show that something works on paper you know and the calculations are very clear until you actually have the physical object and they can they can drive it it doesn't really sink in for people and so that that I think is is something worth noting if you're going to create a company the first thing you should try to do is create a working prototype your everything everything looks great on PowerPoint you can make anything work on PowerPoint but if you have an actual demonstration article even if it's in primitive form that's much much more effective for convincing people so so we made the Tesla Roadster and now we're coming out soon with the Model S which is a four-door sedan because after we made the Tesla Roadster people said oh sure sure we always knew you could make a car like that it's an expensive car and it's low volume and it's small and all that but you can make a real car like okay fine you're gonna make that two so that that's coming out soon and yeah so that that's that that's that's the I think the the word where things are and and and hopefully that there are some lessons to be to be drawn there but I I think the overarching point I want to make is that you guys are the magicians of the 21st century you know don't like anything hold you back imagination is the limit and go out there and create some magic thank you [Applause] I'd like to thank you for leaving crazy person out of the description so I thought I try to think what is the most useful thing that I could what could I say like that could actually helpful or useful to you in the future and I thought perhaps tell the story of how I sort of came to be here how did some of these things happen and and maybe there's some lessons there because I often find myself wondering how did this happen so when I was young I I I didn't really know what I was going to do we're not when I got older people kept asking me and and but but then eventually I thought the idea of inventing things would be would be really cool and the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Odyssey clock which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic and and that's really true if you think if you go back say 300 years the things that we take for granted today would be you'd be burned at the stake for you know being able to fly that's crazy being able to see over long distances being able to communicate having effectively with the internet a a group mind of sorts and having access to all the world's information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth this is the stuff that that really would be magic it would be considered magic in times past in fact I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times past they weren't even in the realm of magic so it actually goes goes beyond that so I thought well you know if if I can do some of those things basically if I can advanced technology then that that's like magic and I would be really cool and the the I always had sort of a slight existential crisis because I was trying to figure out what does it all mean like what's the purpose of things and I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the the knowledge of the world if we can do things that expand the scope and and scale of consciousness then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened and and that's really the only way forward so so it's like I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how how the economy works and you also need to built bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as as an individual if it's if it's a significant technology so I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that I could serve as an alternative to batteries and that was in 95 and that's also when the internet started to happen and and it I I thought well I can either pursue this tech this technology where success may be may not be one of the possible outcomes which is always tricky or participate in the internet and and be part of it so I decided to drop out now is the you unfortunately we're past graduation so I can't be accused of recommending that to you and so did some internet stuff you know they've put a few things here and there what one of which is PayPal and I think maybe it's helpful to say one of the things that was important than in the creation of PayPal was whiskey was kind of how it started because initially the initial thought was with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services so if you have one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and and work smoothly and then we had like a little feature which was through email payments and whenever we'd show that show the system off to someone would show the hard part which was the the agglomeration of financial services which was quite difficult to \",\n",
       " 'cut-off': ' throughout my time at Wyoming area I have pursued every leadership opportunity available to me in addition to being a member of student council since I was a freshman my classmates have also elected me class president in the past four years which has been my greatest honor and I would like to thank you all for that one final time it really means a lot however at our school the title of class president could more accurately a class party planner and student councils main obligation is to paint signs every week the spikes will be outstanding people in our school the lack of a real student government combined with the authoritative attitude that a few teachers administrators and board members have prevent students are truly developing as leaders hopefully this will change ',\n",
       " 'Steve_Jobs': ' This program is brought to you by Stanford University. Please visit us at stanford.edu Thank You. I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. Truth be told I never graduated from college and this is the closest I\\'ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That\\'s it. No big deal. Just three stories. The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: \"We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?\" They said: \"Of course.\" My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life. And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents\\' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn\\'t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn\\'t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting. It wasn\\'t all romantic. I didn\\'t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends\\' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5 cent deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example: Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn\\'t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can\\'t capture, and I found it fascinating. None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it\\'s likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later. Again, you can\\'t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Beleiveing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart Even when it leads you off the well worn path, and that will make all the difference. My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation the Macintosh a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating. I really didn\\'t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over. I didn\\'t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple\\'s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together. I\\'m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn\\'t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don\\'t lose faith. I\\'m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You\\'ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven\\'t found it yet, keep looking. Don\\'t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you\\'ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don\\'t settle. My third story is about death. When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: \"If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you\\'ll most certainly be right.\" It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: \"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?\" And whenever the answer has been \"No\" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. Remembering that I\\'ll be dead soon is the most important tool I\\'ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn\\'t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor\\'s code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you\\'d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes. I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and thankfully I\\'m fine now. This was the closest I\\'ve been to facing death, and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don\\'t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life\\'s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true. Your time is limited, so don\\'t waste it living someone else\\'s life. Don\\'t be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people\\'s thinking. Don\\'t let the noise of others\\' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960\\'s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools, and great notions. Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: \"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.\" It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. Thank you all very much.',\n",
       " 'Tim_Cook': \" MIT thank you congratulations class of seventeen I especially want to thank chairman Maillard president rive distinguished faculty trustees and members of the class of 1967 it's a privilege to be with you today with your families and your friends on such an amazing important day MIT and Apple share so much we both love hard problems we love the search for new ideas and we especially love finding those ideas the really big ones the ones that can change the world I know MIT has a proud tradition of pranks or as you would call them hacks and you've had pulled off some pretty great ones over the years I'll never figure out how MIT students since that Mars rover to the Krusty Oval or put a propeller beanie on the Great Dome or how you've obviously taken over the president's Twitter account I can tell college students are behind it because most of the tweets happen at 3 a.m. I'm really happy to be here today is about celebration and you have so much to be proud of as you leave here to start the next leg of your journey in life there will be days where you will ask yourself where is all this going what is the purpose what is my purpose I'll be honest I asked myself that same question and it took me nearly 15 years to answer it maybe by talking about my journey today I can save you some time the struggle for me started early on in high school I thought I'd discover my life's purpose when I could answer that age-old question what do you want to be when you grow up nope in college I thought I would discover it when I could answer what's your major not quiet I thought that maybe I discover it when I found a good job then I thought I just needed to get a few promotions that didn't work either I kept convincing myself that it was just over the horizon around the next corner nothing worked and it was really tearing me apart part of me kept pushing ahead to the next achievement and the other part kept asking is this all there is I went to grad school at Duke looking for the answer I tried meditation I sought guidance and religion I read great philosophers and authors and in a moment of youthful and discretion I might even have experimented with a Windows PC and obviously that didn't work after countless twists and turns at last 20 years ago my search brought me to Apple at the time the company was struggling to survive Steve Jobs had just returned to Apple and had launched the think different campaign he wanted to empower the crazy ones The Misfits the rebels the troublemakers the round pegs in the square holes to do their best work if we could just do that Steve knew we could really change the world before that moment I had never met a leader with such passion or encountered a company with such a clear and compelling purpose to serve humanity it was just that simple serve humanity and it was in that moment after 15 years of surging something clicked I finally felt aligned aligned with a company that brought together challenging cutting-edge work with a higher purpose aligned with a leader who believed that technology which didn't exist yet could reinvent tomorrow's world aligned with myself and my own deep need to serve something greater of course at that moment I didn't know all of that I was just grateful to have that psychological burden lifted but with the help of hindsight my breakthrough makes a lot more sense I was never going to find my purpose working someplace without a clear sense of purpose of its own Steven Apple freed me to throw my whole self into my work to embrace their mission and make it my own how can I serve humanity this is life's biggest and most important question when you work towards something greater than yourself you find meaning you find purpose so the question I hope you will carry forward from here is how will you serve humanity the good news is since you're here today you're already on a great track at MIT you've learned how much power science and technology had to change the world for the better thanks to discoveries made right here billions of people are leading healthier more productive more fulfilling lives and if we are ever going to solve some of the hardest problems still facing the world today everything from cancer to climate change to educational inequality then technology will help us do it but technology alone isn't the solution and sometimes it's even part of the problem last year I had the chance to meet with Pope Francis it was the most incredible meeting of my life this is a man who has spent more time comforting the afflicted in slums than he has with heads of state this may surprise you but he knew an unbelievable amount about technology it was obvious to me that he had thought deeply about it its opportunities its risks its morality what he said to me at that meeting what he preached really was on a topic we care a lot about it but he expressed a shared concern in a powerful new way never has humanity had such power over itself yet nothing ensures that it will be used wisely he has said technology today is integral to almost all aspects of our lives and most of the time it's a force for good and yet the potential adverse consequences are spreading faster and cutting deeper than ever before threats to our security threats to our privacy fake news and social media that becomes anti-social sometimes the very technology that is meant to connect us divides us technology is capable of doing great things but it doesn't want to do great things it doesn't want anything that part takes all of us it takes our values in our commitment to our families and our neighbors and our communities our love of beauty and belief that all of our fates are interconnected our decency our kindness I'm not worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans I'm more concerned about people thinking like computers without values or compassion without concern for consequences that is what we need you to help us guard against because of silence because if science is a search in the darkness then the humanities are a candle shows us where we've been and the danger that lies ahead as Steve once said technology alone is not enough it is technology married with the liberal arts married with the humanities that make our hearts a when you keep people at the center of what you do it can have an enormous impact it means an iPhone that allows a blind person to run a marathon it means an Apple watch that catches a heart condition before it becomes a heart attack it means an iPad that helps a child with autism connect with his or her world in short it means technology infused with your values making progress possible for everyone whatever you do in your life and whatever we do at Apple we must infuse it with the humanity that each of us is born with that responsibility is immense but so is the opportunity I'm optimistic because I believe in your generation your passion your journey to serve humanity we are all counting on you there is so much out there conspiring to make you cynical the Internet has enabled so much and empowered so many but it can also be a place where basic rules of decency are suspended and pettiness and negativity thrive don't let that noise knock you off course don't get caught up in the trivial aspects of life don't listen to trolls for God's sake don't become one measure your impact on humanity not in likes but in the lives you touch not in popularity but in the people you serve I found that my life got bigger when I stopped caring what other people thought about me you will find yours will to stay focused on what really matters there will be times when you resolve to serve humanity will be tested be prepared people will try to convince you that you should keep your empathy out of your career don't accept this false premise at a shareholders meeting a few years of back someone questioned apples investment and focus on the environment he asked me to pledge that Apple would only invest in green initiatives that could be justified with the return on investment I tried to be diplomatic I pointed out that Apple does many things like accessibility features for those with disabilities that don't rely on an ROI we do these things because they're the right thing to do and protecting the environment is a critical example he wouldn't let it go and I got my blood up so I told him if you can't accept our position you shouldn't own Apple stock when your condensed that your cause is right have the courage to take a stand if you see a problem or an injustice recognize that no one will fix it but you as you go forward today use your minds and hands and your hearts to build something bigger than yourselves always remember there is no idea bigger than this as dr. Martin Luther King said all life is interrelated we are all bound together into a single garment of destiny if you keep that idea at the forefront of all that you do if you choose to live your lives at that intersection between technology and the people it serves if you strive to create the best give the best do the best for everyone not just for some then today all of humanity has good cause for hope thank you very much and congratulations class of 2017 [Applause]\"}"

      " Class of 2009! I don't think I heard you. Class of 2009! First I'd like you to stand up, wave and cheer your supportive family and friends! I'm sure you can find them out there. Show your love! It is a great honor for me to be here today. Now wait a second. I know: that's such a cliche? You're thinking: every graduation speaker says that -- It's a great honor. But, in my case, it really is so deeply true -- being here is more special and more personal for me than most of you know. I'd like to tell you why. A long time ago, in this cold September of 1962, there was a Steven's co-op at this very university. That co-op had a kitchen with a ceiling that had been cleaned by student volunteers probably every decade or so. Picture a college girl named Gloria, climbing up high on a ladder, struggling to clean that filthy ceiling. Standing on the floor, a young boarder named Carl was admiring the view. And that's how they met. They were my parents, so I suppose you could say I'm a direct result of that kitchen chemistry experiment, right here at Michigan. My Mom is here with us today, and we should probably go find the spot and put a plaque up on the ceiling that says: \"Thanks Mom and Dad!\" Everyone in my family went here at Michigan: me, my brother, my Mom and Dad -- all of us. My Dad actually got the quantity discount: all three and a half of his degrees are from here. His Ph.D. was in Communication Science because they thought Computers were just a passing fad. When he earned it 44 years ago. He and Mom made a big sacrifice for that. They argued at times over pennies, while raising my newborn brother. Mom typed my Dad's dissertation by hand. Kind of ironic given it was a computer science dissertation. This velvet hood I'm wearing, this was my Dad's. This diploma, just like the one you're about to get, this was my Dad's. And my underwear... oh never mind. Sorry. My father's father worked in the Chevy plant in Flint, Michigan. He was an assembly line worker. He drove his two children here to Ann Arbor, and told them: That is where you're going to go to college. I know it sounds funny now. Both of his kids did graduate from Michigan. That was the American dream. His daughter, Beverly, is with us today. My Grandpa used to carry an \"Alley Oop\" hammer -- a heavy iron pipe with a hunk of lead melted on the end. The workers made them during the sit-down strikes to protect themselves. When I was growing up, we used that hammer whenever we needed to pound a stake or something into the ground. It is wonderful that most people don't need to carry a heavy blunt object for protection anymore. But just in case, I brought it with me. Al right... My Dad became a professor at... Michigan State, and I was an incredibly lucky boy. A professor's life is pretty flexible, and he was able to spend oodles of time raising me. Could there be a better upbringing than university brat? What I'm trying to tell you is that this is WAY more than just a homecoming for me. It's not easy for me to express how proud I am to be here, with my Mom, my brother and my wife Lucy, and with all of you, at this amazing institution that is responsible for my very existence. I am thrilled for all of you, and I'm thrilled for your families and friends, as all of us join the great, big Michigan family I feel I've been a part of all of my life. What I'm also trying to tell you is that I know exactly what it feels like to be sitting in your seat, listening to some old gasbag give a long-winded commencement speech. Don't worry. I'll be brief. I have a story about following dreams. Or maybe more accurately, it's a story about finding a path to make those dreams real. You know what it's like to wake up in the middle of the night with a vivid dream? And you know how, if you don't have a pencil and pad by the bed, it will be completely gone the next morning? Well, I had one of those dreams when I was 23. When I suddenly woke up, I was thinking: what if we could download the whole web, and just keep the links and... I grabbed a pen and started writing! Sometimes it is important to wake up and stop dreaming. I spent the middle of that night scribbling out the details and convincing myself it would work. Soon after, I told my advisor, Terry Winograd, it would take a couple of weeks to download the web -- he nodded knowingly, fully aware it would take much longer but wise enough to not tell me. The optimism of youth is often underrated! Amazingly, At that time I had no thought of building a search engine. The idea wasn't even on the radar. But, much later we happened upon a better way of ranking and we made a really great search engine, and Google was born. When a really great dream shows up, grab it! When I was here at Michigan, I had actually been taught how to make dreams real! I know it sounds funny, but that is what I learned in a summer camp converted into a training program called Leadershape. Yeh, we got a few out there. Their slogan is to have a \"healthy disregard for the impossible\". That program encouraged me to pursue a crazy idea at the time: I wanted to build a personal rapid transit system on campus to replace the buses. Yeh, you're still working on that, I hear. It was a futuristic way of solving our transportation problem. I still think a lot about transportation -- you never loose a dream, it just incubates as a hobby. Many things that people labor hard to do now, like cooking, cleaning, and driving will require much less human time in the future. That is, if we \"have a healthy disregard for the impossible\" and actually build new solutions. I think it is often easier to make progress on mega-ambitious dreams. I know that sounds completely nuts. But, since no one else is crazy enough to do it, you have little competition. In fact, there are so few people this crazy that I feel like I know them all by first name. They all travel as if they are pack dogs and stick to each other like glue. The best people want to work the big challenges. That is what happened with Google. Our mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. How can that not get you excited? But we almost didn't start Google because my co-founder Sergey and I were too worried about dropping out of our Ph.D. program. None of you have that issue, it seems. You are probably on the right track if you feel like a sidewalk worm during a rainstorm! That is about how we felt after we maxed out three credit cards buying hard disks off the back of a truck. That was actually the first hardware for Google. Parents and friends: more credit cards always help. What is the one sentence summary of how you change the world? Always work hard on something uncomfortably exciting! As a Ph.D. student, I actually had three projects I wanted to work on. Thank goodness my advisor said, \"why don't you work on the web for a while\". He gave me some seriously good advice because the web was really growing with people and activity, even in 1995! Technology and especially the internet can really help you be lazy. Lazy? What I mean is a group of three people can write software that then millions can use and enjoy. Can three people answer the phone a million times? Find the leverage in the world, so you can be more lazy! Overall, I know it seems like the world is crumbling out there, but it is actually a great time in your life to get a little crazy, follow your curiosity, and be ambitious about it. Don't give up on your dreams. The world needs you all! So here's my final story: On a day like today, you might feel exhilarated — like you've just been shot out of a cannon at the circus -- and even invincible. Don't ever forget that incredible feeling. But also: always remember that the moments we have with friends and family, the chances we have to do things that might make a big difference in the world, or even to make a small difference to someone you love — all those wonderful chances that life gives us, life also takes away. It can happen fast, and a whole lot sooner than you think. In late March 1996, soon after I had moved to Stanford for grad school, my Dad had difficultly breathing and drove to the hospital. Two months later, he died. I was completely devastated. Many years later, after a startup, after falling in love, and after so many of life's adventures, I found myself thinking about my Dad. Lucy and I were far away in a steaming hot village walking through narrow streets. There were wonderful friendly people everywhere, but it was a desperately poor place -- people used the bathroom inside and it flowed out into the open gutter and straight into the river. We touched a boy with a limp leg, the result of paralysis from polio. Lucy and I were in rural India -- one of the few places where Polio still exists. Polio is transmitted fecal to oral, usually through filthy water. Well, my Dad had Polio. He went on a trip to Tennessee in the first grade and caught it. He was hospitalized for two months and had to be transported by military DC-3 back home -- his first flight. My Dad wrote, \"Then, I had to stay in bed for over a year, before I started back to school\". That is actually a quote from his fifth grade autobiography. My Dad had difficulty breathing his whole life, and the complications of Polio are what took him from us too soon. He would have been very upset that Polio still persists even though we have a vaccine. He would have been equally upset that back in India we had polio virus on our shoes from walking through the contaminated gutters that spread the disease. We were spreading the virus with every footstep, right under beautiful kids playing everywhere. The world is on the verge of eliminating polio, with 328 people infected so far. Let's get it done soon. Perhaps one of you will do that. My Dad was valedictorian of the Flint Mandeville High School class of 1956 of about 90 kids. I happened across his graduating speech recently, and it blew me away. 53 years ago at his graduation my Dad said: \"...we are entering a changing world, one of automation and employment change where education is an economic necessity. We will have increased periods of time to do as we wish, as our work week and retirement age continue to decline... (Or we wish that were true....) We shall take part in, or witness, developments in science, medicine, and industry that we can only dream of today. ... It is said that the future of any nation can be determined by the care and preparation given to its youth. If all the youths of America were as fortunate in securing an education as we have been, then the future of the United States would be even more bright than it is today.\" If my Dad was alive today, the thing I think he would be most happy about is that Lucy and I have a baby in the hopper. Yeh, let's cheer Lucy. I think he would have been annoyed that I hadn't gotten my Ph.D. yet (thanks, Michigan!). Dad was so full of insights, of excitement about new things, to this day, I often wonder what he would think about some new development. If he were here today -- well, it would be one of the best days of his life. He'd be like a kid in a candy store. For a day, he'd be young again. Many of us are fortunate enough to be here with family. Some of us have dear friends and family to go home to. And who knows, perhaps some of you, like Lucy and I, are dreaming of future families of your own. Just like me, your families brought you here, and you brought them here. Please keep them close and remember: they are what really matters in life. Thanks, Mom; Thanks, Lucy. And thank you, all, very much. \n"

      " class of  i dont think i heard you class of  first id like you to stand up wave and cheer your supportive family and friends im sure you can find them out there show your love it is a great honor for me to be here today now wait a second i know thats such a cliche youre thinking every graduation speaker says that  its a great honor but in my case it really is so deeply true  being here is more special and more personal for me than most of you know id like to tell you why a long time ago in this cold september of  there was a stevens coop at this very university that coop had a kitchen with a ceiling that had been cleaned by student volunteers probably every decade or so picture a college girl named gloria climbing up high on a ladder struggling to clean that filthy ceiling standing on the floor a young boarder named carl was admiring the view and thats how they met they were my parents so i suppose you could say im a direct result of that kitchen chemistry experiment right here at michigan my mom is here with us today and we should probably go find the spot and put a plaque up on the ceiling that says thanks mom and dad everyone in my family went here at michigan me my brother my mom and dad  all of us my dad actually got the quantity discount all three and a half of his degrees are from here his phd was in communication science because they thought computers were just a passing fad when he earned it  years ago he and mom made a big sacrifice for that they argued at times over pennies while raising my newborn brother mom typed my dads dissertation by hand kind of ironic given it was a computer science dissertation this velvet hood im wearing this was my dads this diploma just like the one youre about to get this was my dads and my underwear oh never mind sorry my fathers father worked in the chevy plant in flint michigan he was an assembly line worker he drove his two children here to ann arbor and told them that is where youre going to go to college i know it sounds funny now both of his kids did graduate from michigan that was the american dream his daughter beverly is with us today my grandpa used to carry an alley oop hammer  a heavy iron pipe with a hunk of lead melted on the end the workers made them during the sitdown strikes to protect themselves when i was growing up we used that hammer whenever we needed to pound a stake or something into the ground it is wonderful that most people dont need to carry a heavy blunt object for protection anymore but just in case i brought it with me al right my dad became a professor at michigan state and i was an incredibly lucky boy a professors life is pretty flexible and he was able to spend oodles of time raising me could there be a better upbringing than university brat what im trying to tell you is that this is way more than just a homecoming for me its not easy for me to express how proud i am to be here with my mom my brother and my wife lucy and with all of you at this amazing institution that is responsible for my very existence i am thrilled for all of you and im thrilled for your families and friends as all of us join the great big michigan family i feel ive been a part of all of my life what im also trying to tell you is that i know exactly what it feels like to be sitting in your seat listening to some old gasbag give a longwinded commencement speech dont worry ill be brief i have a story about following dreams or maybe more accurately its a story about finding a path to make those dreams real you know what its like to wake up in the middle of the night with a vivid dream and you know how if you dont have a pencil and pad by the bed it will be completely gone the next morning well i had one of those dreams when i was  when i suddenly woke up i was thinking what if we could download the whole web and just keep the links and i grabbed a pen and started writing sometimes it is important to wake up and stop dreaming i spent the middle of that night scribbling out the details and convincing myself it would work soon after i told my advisor terry winograd it would take a couple of weeks to download the web  he nodded knowingly fully aware it would take much longer but wise enough to not tell me the optimism of youth is often underrated amazingly at that time i had no thought of building a search engine the idea wasnt even on the radar but much later we happened upon a better way of ranking and we made a really great search engine and google was born when a really great dream shows up grab it when i was here at michigan i had actually been taught how to make dreams real i know it sounds funny but that is what i learned in a summer camp converted into a training program called leadershape yeh we got a few out there their slogan is to have a healthy disregard for the impossible that program encouraged me to pursue a crazy idea at the time i wanted to build a personal rapid transit system on campus to replace the buses yeh youre still working on that i hear it was a futuristic way of solving our transportation problem i still think a lot about transportation  you never loose a dream it just incubates as a hobby many things that people labor hard to do now like cooking cleaning and driving will require much less human time in the future that is if we have a healthy disregard for the impossible and actually build new solutions i think it is often easier to make progress on megaambitious dreams i know that sounds completely nuts but since no one else is crazy enough to do it you have little competition in fact there are so few people this crazy that i feel like i know them all by first name they all travel as if they are pack dogs and stick to each other like glue the best people want to work the big challenges that is what happened with google our mission is to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful how can that not get you excited but we almost didnt start google because my cofounder sergey and i were too worried about dropping out of our phd program none of you have that issue it seems you are probably on the right track if you feel like a sidewalk worm during a rainstorm that is about how we felt after we maxed out three credit cards buying hard disks off the back of a truck that was actually the first hardware for google parents and friends more credit cards always help what is the one sentence summary of how you change the world always work hard on something uncomfortably exciting as a phd student i actually had three projects i wanted to work on thank goodness my advisor said why dont you work on the web for a while he gave me some seriously good advice because the web was really growing with people and activity even in  technology and especially the internet can really help you be lazy lazy what i mean is a group of three people can write software that then millions can use and enjoy can three people answer the phone a million times find the leverage in the world so you can be more lazy overall i know it seems like the world is crumbling out there but it is actually a great time in your life to get a little crazy follow your curiosity and be ambitious about it dont give up on your dreams the world needs you all so heres my final story on a day like today you might feel exhilarated — like youve just been shot out of a cannon at the circus  and even invincible dont ever forget that incredible feeling but also always remember that the moments we have with friends and family the chances we have to do things that might make a big difference in the world or even to make a small difference to someone you love — all those wonderful chances that life gives us life also takes away it can happen fast and a whole lot sooner than you think in late march  soon after i had moved to stanford for grad school my dad had difficultly breathing and drove to the hospital two months later he died i was completely devastated many years later after a startup after falling in love and after so many of lifes adventures i found myself thinking about my dad lucy and i were far away in a steaming hot village walking through narrow streets there were wonderful friendly people everywhere but it was a desperately poor place  people used the bathroom inside and it flowed out into the open gutter and straight into the river we touched a boy with a limp leg the result of paralysis from polio lucy and i were in rural india  one of the few places where polio still exists polio is transmitted fecal to oral usually through filthy water well my dad had polio he went on a trip to tennessee in the first grade and caught it he was hospitalized for two months and had to be transported by military  back home  his first flight my dad wrote then i had to stay in bed for over a year before i started back to school that is actually a quote from his fifth grade autobiography my dad had difficulty breathing his whole life and the complications of polio are what took him from us too soon he would have been very upset that polio still persists even though we have a vaccine he would have been equally upset that back in india we had polio virus on our shoes from walking through the contaminated gutters that spread the disease we were spreading the virus with every footstep right under beautiful kids playing everywhere the world is on the verge of eliminating polio with  people infected so far lets get it done soon perhaps one of you will do that my dad was valedictorian of the flint mandeville high school class of  of about  kids i happened across his graduating speech recently and it blew me away  years ago at his graduation my dad said we are entering a changing world one of automation and employment change where education is an economic necessity we will have increased periods of time to do as we wish as our work week and retirement age continue to decline or we wish that were true we shall take part in or witness developments in science medicine and industry that we can only dream of today  it is said that the future of any nation can be determined by the care and preparation given to its youth if all the youths of america were as fortunate in securing an education as we have been then the future of the united states would be even more bright than it is today if my dad was alive today the thing i think he would be most happy about is that lucy and i have a baby in the hopper yeh lets cheer lucy i think he would have been annoyed that i hadnt gotten my phd yet thanks michigan dad was so full of insights of excitement about new things to this day i often wonder what he would think about some new development if he were here today  well it would be one of the best days of his life hed be like a kid in a candy store for a day hed be young again many of us are fortunate enough to be here with family some of us have dear friends and family to go home to and who knows perhaps some of you like lucy and i are dreaming of future families of your own just like me your families brought you here and you brought them here please keep them close and remember they are what really matters in life thanks mom thanks lucy and thank you all very much \n"
